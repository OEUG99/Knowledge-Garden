- # Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
	- ## Overview
		- A protocol that allows a program to request a service or execute a procedure on a remote system as if it were local.
		- Useful in distributed computing but also introduces significant security concerns.
	- ## How It Works
		- 1. A client sends a request to a remote server to execute a function or procedure.
		  2. The server processes the request and sends back results.
		  3. The communication is abstracted, so the client code appears to call a local procedure.
	- ## Key Concepts
		- **RPC implements a stub**: An interface that abstracts away underlying network details.
	- ## Security Threats
		- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks**
		- **Authentication weaknesses**
		- **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks**
		- **Code injection**
		- **Privilege escalation**
		- **Replay attacks**
	- # Threat Detection
		- ## Techniques
			- **Traffic analysis**
			- **Vulnerability scanners**
			- **Penetration testing**
			- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**
	- # Historical Exploits
		- ## EternalBlue (WannaCry)
			- SMB exploit that was RPC-dependent.
		- ## SigRed
			- Exploited Windows DNS, an RPC-related flaw.
		- ## gRPC Exploits
			- Exploits targeting gRPC implementations.
