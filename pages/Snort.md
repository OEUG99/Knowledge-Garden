## Snort (IDS/IPS)
	- **Snort** is a powerful IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System).
- ### Three main operational modes:
	- 1. **Packet Sniffing**:
		- Collects and displays network traffic, similar to Wireshark.
	- 2. **Packet Logging**:
		- Collects and logs network traffic to a file.
	- 3. **Network Intrusion Detection**:  
	   Analyzes packets and matches traffic against signatures to detect intrusions.
- ### Snort Rules
	- Snort rules are very similar to typical firewall rules.
- ### Snort Rule Syntax
