- This Logseq graph uses a custom secret management service designed by [[@Oli Eugenio]].
  title:: Graph/Secret
- Next to every #Graph/Secret tag will have an external link to the secrets manager. All the secrets are hidden by a global password, once entered the secrets manager website will display the contents.
- This graph employs the use of secrets in such a manner, due to all the notes being publicly available.
- The secret manager is freely available on its GitHub repo, which can be found in [[Projects/Secrets Manager]]. If you would like to host your own instance, feel free to do so.
	- Alternatively, you could use [pastebin](pastebin.com) and create password protected pastes or private pastes and link those instead if you are not able to host your own instance.
