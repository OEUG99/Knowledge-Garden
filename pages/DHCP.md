# Understanding DHCP
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**:
	- Automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, etc.
- ## DHCP Components
  1. **DHCP Server**:
	- Manages the pool of IP addresses and configuration data.
	  
	  2. **DHCP Clients**:
	- Request configuration details (typically phones, PCs, etc.).
	  
	  3. **DHCP Relay Agents**:
	- Forwards requests between clients and a DHCP server when they are not on the same subnet.

- # DHCP Process (DORA)
  
  1. **Discovery**:
	- Client broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER to find a server.
	  
	  2. **Offer**:
	- DHCP Server responds with a DHCPOFFER containing an available IP.
	  
	  3. **Request**:
	- The client replies with a DHCPREQUEST to accept the offered configuration.
	  
	  4. **Acknowledgement**:
	- The server confirms with a DHCPACK, finalizing the lease.

- # DHCP Modes
- **Automatic Allocation**:
	- Permanent IP assigned to a client out of a pool of available IPs.
	- Remains the same unless DHCP configuration changes.
- **Dynamic Allocation**:
	- IP assigned to a client temporarily. After it times out, it either renews or releases.
- **Manual Allocation**:
	- Set by an administrator.
