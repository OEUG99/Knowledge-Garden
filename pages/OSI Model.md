- # Understanding the OSI Model
  id:: 6759bee7-0336-4a99-be52-8a5f4f80c2a4
- The OSI model provides for different computer systems to communicate with each other. It consists of **7 abstract layers**, each responsible for a specific function and communicating with the layer below it.
- ## The Layers
	- ### # 7 - Application Layer
		- Only layer that directly interacts with data from the user.
	- ### # 6 - Presentation Layer
		- Responsible for preparing data so it can be used by the application layer.
		- **Functions**:
			- Encryption
			- Compression
			- Translation
	- ### # 5 - Session Layer
		- Responsible for opening and closing communication between two devices.
	- ### # 4 - Transport Layer
		- Responsible for end-to-end communication between devices.
		- **Functions**:
			- Breaks data from the application layer into **segments**.
			- Transfers these segments using protocols like **TCP**.
			- Provides error detection using checksums.
		- Employs **Windowing** to match sender's speed with receiver's capacity.
		- **Multiplexing and Demultiplexing**:
			- Allows multiple applications to send and receive data simultaneously using port numbers.
		- #### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
		- Ensures reliable transmission of packets.
		- Designed to prevent:
			- Loss of packets
			- Out-of-order packets
			- Duplicate packets
		- **Establishes a connection**, making it suitable for large, ordered data.
		- #### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
		- Connectionless protocol that sends messages, called **datagrams**, without establishing a connection.
		- **Characteristics**:
			- No guarantee of delivery, order, or error-checking.
			- Lightweight and has lower latency.
			- Supports sending to multiple recipients more efficiently.
	- ### # 3 - Network Layer
		- Responsible for determining how data is routed, transmitted, and received across different networks.
		- **Functions**:
			- Assigns logical addresses (**IP addresses**) to devices.
			- Determines the best path for data to travel across the network (**routing**).
			- Forwards packets based on destination IP addresses.
		- **Packet Handling**:
			- Packets contain headers with destination IP addresses.
			- **Routers and switches** use this information to send/forward packets.
	- ### # 2 - Data Link Layer
		- Facilitates reliable communication between directly connected devices.
		- **Functions**:
			- Employs the use of **frames**.
			- Utilizes **MAC addresses**:
				- Assigned to network interfaces.
				- Used to deliver frames to the correct device.
			- Manages media access to physical mediums to avoid collisions and ensures orderly communication.
			- Detects errors but does not correct them.
		- **Common Protocols**:
			- Ethernet
			- Wi-Fi
	- ### # 1 - Physical Layer
		- Responsible for transmitting raw binary data across physical mediums.
