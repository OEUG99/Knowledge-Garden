- # CHIP-8 Emulator and Assembler
	- This project began as a personal exploration into the captivating world of emulation - a field of computing that blends low-level computer architecture with intricate operations. Through my love of retro video games, the idea of creating a CHIP-8 Emulator and Assembler took root. CHIP-8, with its accessible design and manageable complexity, proved to be an ideal entry point for this emulation adventure.
	- ## The History of CHIP-8
		- The CHIP-8 is what is commonly described as a "fantasy console". It is not a physical machine, rather a conceptual virtual machine created in the mind of microcomputer researcher Joseph Weisbecker in the mid 1970s, and its aim was to simplify video game programming on early microcomputers, by providing consistency over a range of differing hardware.
			- The specification for [[Chip-8]] can be found in my dedicate page for it.
		- The use of CHIP-8 has continued well into the 21st century, with modern programming contests and game jams often featuring CHIP-8 categories. Classes on operating system design and embedded systems often use CHIP-8 due to its simplicity yet broad scope in understanding the basics of system design.
	- ## Project's Structure
		- This project had three distinct phases. Each proceeding phase has built on top of the previous stage, adding more complexity to the overall scope of the project.
		- The stages are as followed:
			- **Stage 1 -  The Emulator:**  â€“  The heart of the project took the form of an interpreter for the CHIP-8 language. It entailed a deep dive into the inner workings of the CHIP-8 system to read, decode, and execute CHIP-8 program instructions accurately. This stage involved an in-depth exploration of computer architecture, reiterating the fundamentals of bitwise operations, which stood as an integral part of the Emulator's operation.
