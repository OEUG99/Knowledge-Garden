- A "dropper" is a type of malicious software (malware) that installs other malicious programs on a victim's device.
- Once the dropper infiltrates the system, it secretly delivers and executes the additional malware, often without the user's knowledge.
- The additional malware can perform various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive data, damaging files, or enabling unauthorized remote access.
- Droppers are commonly used to distribute various types of malware, like trojans, ransomware, or spyware.
