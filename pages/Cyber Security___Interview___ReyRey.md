# Interview Review
	- ##  Preface
		- I initially applied for a DevOps position; however, I have been asked to interview for Cyber Security role. I looked into the Job description to see if there would be any good topics to focus on for review, I also then attempted to research what the companies architecture looks like so I could review related materials.
		- Because details regarding architecture/implementation were sparse, I also looked at what companies in the same field are doing to help with my review.
