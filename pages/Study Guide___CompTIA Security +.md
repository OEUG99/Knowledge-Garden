  Last-Revised:: [[Jan 26th, 2024]]
  tags:: #Graph/ISSUE/Grammar
	- The CompTIA Security+ Exam is created to be vendor-neutral for all cyber-security professionals. It is a good certificate for entering into the field.
	- The exam is recommended for those wishing to work as:
		- Systems administrators.
		- Security Administrators.
		- Security specialist.
		- Security Engineers.
		- Network Adminstrator.
		- Junior IT Auditor/Penetration tester
		- Security consultant.
	- The exam is a "performance -based assessment" , therefore it questions vary from multiple-choice, fill in the blank, multiple response, and interactive question formats, including image based questions.
	- The exam is timed, and you will be provided with 90 minutes to complete it. It features up to 90 questions, and is scored on a scale ranging from 100 to 900, with the passing score of 750.
	- ## ðŸ§­ Key Topics / Table of Contents.
		- The exam is structured around 5 key domains:
			- Threats, Attacks, and Vulernabilities.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Architecture and Design.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Implementation.

				- #### Confidenitality
				  id:: 65b3fb5a-d2a5-44c3-831d-30c17a78d6b6
					- What is **Confidenitality?** #card
						- {{cloze Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information.}}
				- Hackers may try to undermine **confidentiality** controls to achieve one of their goals, the unauthorized disclosure of information, like with database breaches.
				- #### Integrity
					- What is **Integrity**? #card
						- {{cloze Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally.}}
					- **Integrity** is usually implemented through various tools, like the use of hashes to verify if files are the same.
					- **Integrity** threats may come from attackers seeking the alteration of information without authorization or non-malicious sources, such as a power spike causing the corruption of information.
				- #### Avaliability
					- What is **Avaliability?** #card
						- {{cloze Avalibility ensures that the information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitmate users at the time those users request them.}}
					- **Availability** is commonly seen through the use of fault tolerances , clustering, backups, etc.
					- Availability threats may come from either attackers seeking the disruption of access or non-malicious sources, such as natural disasters like fires, destroying datacenter that contain valuable information/services.
						-
				- Security incidents occur when an organization experiences a breach of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information.
				- Security professionals are responsible for understanding such risks and implementing appropriate designed controls to mitigate risks to an acceptable level.

					- What is **Alteration**? #card
						- {{cloze Alteration is the unauthorized modification of information.}}
					- What principle of the ((65b5c362-a65b-4496-a9ed-e4e947d8d6e1)) does **Alteration** violate? #card
						- {{cloze It violates the principle of integrity.}}
					- Attackers may try to modify records in a system to obtain finical gain, such as fraud transactions.
					- Alteration can also occur to due natural faults, such as power outages when bits flips or when information isn't fully process at the time of the fault.
					- Accidental alteration is also a possibility, these occur via unintentional modification of information, such as with typos.
