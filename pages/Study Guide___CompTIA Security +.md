				- #### Confidenitality
					- What is **Confidenitality?** #card
						- {{cloze Confidentiality ensures that unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information.}}
				- Hackers may try to undermine **confidentiality** controls to achieve one of their goals, the unauthorized disclosure of information, like with database breaches.
				- #### Integrity
					- What is **Integrity**? #card
						- {{cloze Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally.}}
					- **Integrity** is usually implemented through various tools, like the use of hashes to verify if files are the same.
					- **Integrity** threats may come from attackers seeking the alteration of information without authorization or non-malicious sources, such as a power spike causing the corruption of information.
				- #### Avaliability
					- What is **Avaliability?** #card
						- {{cloze Avalibility ensures that the information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitmate users at the time those users request them.}}
					- **Availability** is commonly seen through the use of fault tolerances , clustering, backups, etc.
					- Availability threats may come from either attackers seeking the disruption of access or non-malicious sources, such as natural disasters like fires, destroying datacenter that contain valuable information/services.
						-
			- Security incidents occur when an organization experiences a breach of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information.
			- Security professionals are responsible for understanding such risks and implementing appropriate designed controls to mitigate risks to an acceptable level.
			- ### The DAD Triad
				- The DAD triad is closely related to the ((65b5c362-a65b-4496-a9ed-e4e947d8d6e1)), however, the main goal of the DAD triad is to describve the three key threats to cybersecurity.
