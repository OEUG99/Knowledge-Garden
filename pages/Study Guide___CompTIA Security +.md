				- #### Integrity
					- What is **Integrity**? #card
						- {{cloze Integrity ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems, either intentionally or unintentionally.}}
					- **Integrity** is usually implemented through various tools, like the use of hashes to verify if files are the same.
					- **Integrity** threats may come from attackers seeking the alteration of information without authorization or non-malicious sources, such as a power spike causing the corruption of information.
				- #### Avaliability
					- What is **Avaliability?** #card
						- {{cloze Avalibility ensures that the information and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitmate users at the time those users request them.}}
					- **Availability** is commonly seen through the use of fault tolerances , clustering, backups, etc.
					- Availability threats may come from either attackers seeking the disruption of access or non-malicious sources, such as natural disasters like fires, destroying datacenter that contain valuable information/services.
						-
				- Security incidents occur when an organization experiences a breach of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of information.
				- Security professionals are responsible for understanding such risks and implementing appropriate designed controls to mitigate risks to an acceptable level.

						- {{cloze It violates the principle of integrity.}}
					- Attackers may try to modify records in a system to obtain finical gain, such as fraud transactions.
					- Alteration can also occur to due natural faults, such as power outages when bits flips or when information isn't fully process at the time of the fault.
					- Accidental alteration is also a possibility, these occur via unintentional modification of information, such as with typos.

	- ## Breach Impact
		- The potential impact of a security incident is usually categories in terms of risk.
		- ### Types of Risk
			- What are the types of risk? #card
				- {{cloze Financial Risk}}
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- {{cloze Reputational Risk}}
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				  id:: 65b7f7bb-1295-45ed-a75d-3cd0c21367ae

				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- {{cloze Operational Risk}}
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- {{cloze Compliance Risk.}}
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- #### Financial Risk
				- The risk of monetary damages to the organization as a result of a data breach.
					- This could be **direct financial damage**, such as when you need to rebuild a data center after a natural disaster, or the cost of contracting experts for an incident response.
					- This could also be **indirect finical damage**. For example, when an employee loses a laptop containing future plans and there are no backup, the organization loses all the cost spent on research and development. They could be even more severe, such as when a competitor gets a hold of those plans and beats you to the market.
					- What are the two types of financial damage? #card
						- {{cloze Direct financial damage - When you have to pay to recover. }}
						  logseq.order-list-type:: number
						- {{cloze Indirect financial damage - when you lose out on revenue/investments lost. }}
						  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- #### Reputational Risk
				- **Reputational risks** occur when the negative publicity surround a security breach causes the loss of goodwill among customers, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders.
					- What is the most common impact in terms of a security breach affecting customers, employees, and other stakeholders? #card
						- {{cloze The risk of identity theft.}}
			- #### Strategic Risk
			  id:: 65b8004b-7ae0-463c-a6e1-ba85c1db193b
				- **Strategic Risk** is the risk that an organization will become less effective in meeting its major goals and objectives as a result of the breach.
					- An employee losing a laptop provides a strategic risk if that laptop contains the only copy of information, as this will delay development. It also poses a strategic risk because it gives your competitors time to make developments and get to market first.
			- #### Operational Risk
			  id:: 65b8094a-697c-467a-ad8e-4ff6dd04c087
				- **Operational Risk** is a risk to the organization's ability to carry out its day-to-day functions.
					- it may slow down daily operations.
					- Operational Risk and ((65b8004b-7ae0-463c-a6e1-ba85c1db193b)) are closely related.
						- How do you tell the difference between ((65b8094a-697c-467a-ad8e-4ff6dd04c087)) and ((65b8004b-7ae0-463c-a6e1-ba85c1db193b))? #card
							- {{cloze If a risk threatens the existence of an organization/ability of the organization to execute its business plan, that is a strategic risk.}}
							- {{cloze If the risk only causes inefficiency and delay within the organization, then it is an operational risk.}}
			- #### Compliance Risk
				- **Compliance risk** arises when a security breach leads an organization to violate legal or regulatory obligations.
