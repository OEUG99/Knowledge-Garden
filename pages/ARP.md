# What is ARP?
- **Address Resolution Protocol**:
	- Fundamental networking protocol that plays a crucial role in enabling communication within local area networks (LANs).
- It is a network protocol used for mapping an IP address to a physical MAC address.
- ARP works in the data link layer (Layer 2).
- ARP is stateless, and requests typically broadcast to all devices on a network because the requesting device does not initially know the MAC address of the target device.

- # How does ARP work?
- ## Steps:
  1. **Request**: When a device wants to send data to another device on the same LAN, it first sends an ARP request, broadcasting a message like:
	- "Who has IP address x.x.x.x? Tell MAC address y.y.y.y."
	  
	  2. **Response**: The device with the requested IP address responds with an ARP reply, providing its MAC address.
	  
	  3. **Cache**: Both devices cache the mapping of IP address to MAC in their ARP tables to avoid repeated unnecessary broadcasts.

- # ARP Threats and Attack Vectors
- **ARP spoofing/poisoning**:
	- Attackers manipulate ARP tables via false requests.
- **ARP spoofing** can be used for MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks as well as DoS (Denial of Service).
- **Reconnaissance**:
	- `arp-scan` can discover live devices on the network by identifying MAC and IP addresses.

- # ARP Threat Mitigation
- **Static ARP entries**:
	- For critical devices or small networks, static mappings can be used to prevent manipulation.
- **Dynamic ARP Inspection**:
	- Many managed network switches offer this feature that verifies ARP packets against a trusted database.
- **Network Segmentation**:
	- Isolate sensitive devices into separate VLANs to reduce exposure to ARP attacks.
- **Encryption**:
	- End-to-end encryption like HTTPS/VPNs ensures confidentiality.
- **Gratuitous ARP Filtering**:
	- Configuring network equipment to block unsolicited ARP responses.
