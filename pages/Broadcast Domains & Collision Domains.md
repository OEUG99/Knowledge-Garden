- # Broadcast Domains and Collision Domains
- ## Broadcast Domain
	- A Broadcast domain is a segment of a network where a broadcast frame (aka a packet sent to all devices in the net) is forwarded.
	- Devices within the same broadcast domain can receive these broadcasts.
	- Downsides:
		- The more devices in a domain, the more packets get forwarded.
	- VLANs can be used to create separate domains.
	- **Example:** ARP uses broadcast frames/domains.
- ## Collision Domain
	- Collision domains are network segments where data can "collide" during transmission.
	- Collisions cause retransmissions, reducing network efficiency.
	- Modern technology uses multiplexing to mitigate collisions.
	- **tExample:** Think retro phone lines, how two people can't use the line at once without an issue.
