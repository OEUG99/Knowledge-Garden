- # SSL/TLS
- **SSL/TLS** is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over the internet.
- It fully implements **C.I.A**:
	- **Confidentiality**
	- **Integrity**
	- **Authentication**
- ## How SSL/TLS Works
- **TLS Handshake**: The process of setting up a secure communication channel between the client (e.g., browser) and the server.
	- The point is to:
		- Agree on encryption parameters.
		- Authenticate the server.
		- Generate a shared session key for encrypting data.
- ## TLS Handshake Step by Step
- ### 1. Client Hello
	- The client starts the handshake by sending:
		- Supported encryption algorithms
		- Random data used for creating session keys
		- TLS version
	- Essentially, this starts negotiating.
- ### 2. Server Hello
	- The server picks an encryption algorithm that works and sends:
		- Random data (used with client data for key generation)
- ### 3. Server Certificate
	- The server sends its **digital certificate**, issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
	- The certificate contains:
		- **Server's public key**
		- **Domain name** (to verify identity)
		- **CA's digital signature**
	- This proves the server's identity to the client.
- ### 4. Key Exchange
	- The client generates a **pre-master secret** (random number) and encrypts it with the server's **public key** (from the certificate).
	- The encrypted data is sent to the server.
	- This allows the client and server to securely derive a shared session key that no one can compute, even if they intercept the handshake.
- ### 5. Session Key Generation
	- Both the client and server use the pre-master key and random numbers to compute the **session key**, which will be used for **symmetric encryption**.
- ### 6. Handshake Completion
	- Both parties send **"Finished"** messages encrypted with the session key to verify that encryption/decryption is working.
