- Unpacking in Python refers to assigning multiple variables at one time from an iterable like list, tuple, or dictionary. This feature allows you to extract the values and assign them to the variables in a single statement, improving code readability and efficiency.
- Here is a simple example of unpacking a list:
  ```python
  values = [1, 2, 3]
  a, b, c  = values
  ```
- # Unpacking Operators (star and double star operators)
	- In Python, the unpacking operators are asterisks (`*` and `**`), also known as the star and double star operator. They are used in conjunction with an iterable or a mapping type such as a list, tuple, or dictionary respectively to unpack the values.
	- The single asterisk `*` is used for unpacking sequences into single values and the double asterisk `**` is used for unpacking dictionary items into key-value pairs.
		- Here is how the `*` operator works while unpacking a sequence into single values:
		  ```python
		  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		  a, *b, c = numbers
		  ```
			- In this example, `a` will be assigned the first value in `numbers` (1), `c` will be assigned the last value (5), and `*b` will "absorb" all the values in between (2, 3, 4), making `b` equal to [2, 3, 4]. This demonstrates how the star operator can be used to unpack values from iterable types where the exact length might not be known or relevant.
		- If you have a sequence with more (or less) items than variables, a `ValueError` will be raised. To handle this, you can use an asterisk to "absorb" the extra values:
		  ```python
		  values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
		  a, b, *c = values
		  ```
	- Similarly, the `**` operator can be used to absorb values from dictionaries:
	  ```python
	  person = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
	  def func(name, age, city):
	      print(name, age, city)
	  func(**person)
	  ```
		- In this example, `**person` passes the items from the `person` dictionary as keyword arguments to the function `func`, effectively unpacking them. The function will print: `John 25 New York`.
