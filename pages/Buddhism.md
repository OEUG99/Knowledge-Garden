- # What is Buddhism?
	- Buddhism is a major world religion founded in ancient India around the 6th century BCE. It is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha (which means "the awakened one").
	- Early Buddhism was influenced by [[Hinduism]]. It is a [[Dharma]] based religion.
	- ## Core Beliefs
		- **Three Marks of Existence**
			- Viewing the Three Marks as a diagnosis and a disease is a metaphorical way to help understand their role in Buddhism. The three marks describe the nature of all phenomena.
			- The Three Marks of Existence are as follows:
				- **Suffering and Dissatisfaction ([[Dukkha]])**: Dukkha refers to the suffering and dissatisfaction that plagues humane existence. However, it also refers to the discontentment that may arise from the impermanent nature of reality.

				- **Impermanence (Anicca):**  Anicca refers to the universal truth of impermanence. It suggests that all phenomena are subject to change. Nothing in the world is in a fixed state, such as materials, or even mental. It is about Birth, aging, decay, and death, and how they are core aspects of existence.

				- **Non-Self (Anatta)**:  Anatta challenges the idea of an unchanging self, ego, or soul (Atman). It suggests that all phenomena, including the self are devoid of an intrinsic existence; or in other words, what appears to be "me" is neither solid, stable, nor enduring.
