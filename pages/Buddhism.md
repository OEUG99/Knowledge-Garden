- # Introduciton
	- Buddhism is a major world religion founded in ancient India around the 6th century BCE. It is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha (which means "the awakened one").
	- Early Buddhism was influenced by [[Hinduism]]. It is a [[Dharma]] based religion.
	- ## Core Beliefs
		- **Three Marks of Existence**
			- Viewing the Three Marks as a diagnosis and a disease is a metaphorical way to help understand their role in Buddhism. The three marks describe the nature of all phenomena.
			- The Three Marks of Existence are as follows:
				- **Suffering and Dissatisfaction ([[Dukkha]])**: Dukkha refers to the suffering and dissatisfaction that plagues humane existence. However, it also refers to the discontentment that may arise from the impermanent nature of reality.

				- **Impermanence (Anicca):**  Anicca refers to the universal truth of impermanence. It suggests that all phenomena are subject to change. Nothing in the world is in a fixed state, such as materials, or even mental. It is about Birth, aging, decay, and death, and how they are core aspects of existence.

				- **Non-Self (Anatta)**:  Anatta challenges the idea of an unchanging self, ego, or soul (Atman). It suggests that all phenomena, including the self are devoid of an intrinsic existence; or in other words, what appears to be "me" is neither solid, stable, nor enduring.

		- ### Four Noble Truths
			- The four nobles can best be explained as a diagnosis for the human condition, as the Buddha often considered himself to be more inlined with a physician then the founder of a religion.
			- The Four Noble Truths provide a diagnostic framework for understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation.
			- The Four Novel Truths are as follows:
				- The Truth of [[Dukkha]].

		- ### Noble Eightfold Path
			- The Noble Eightfold Path outlines the path one can take for achieving enlightenment and liberation from suffering (Nirvana).
			- It is considered one of the core teachings of the Buddha. Each of the paths are interconnected, and has no direct order. It serves as a guideline for ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom development.
			- The Eightfold Path is as follows:
				- **Right Understanding (Samma-ditthi)**: This is an understanding of the Four Noble Truths, the nature of suffering, its causes,  cessation, and the path leading to its cessation. It also refers to the understanding of impermanence and the interconnectedness of all phenomena.
