- # What is a Greedy Algorithm?
  heading:: 1
	- Video: https://youtu.be/HzeK7g8cD0Y
	- **Definition:**  An algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving approach of making the `locally optimal` choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
	- ## What are it's pros and cons?
	  heading:: 2
		- **Pros:** simple, easy to implement, runs fast.
		- **Cons:** Very often they don't provide a globally optimum solution.
	- # When do we use greedy algorithms?
	  heading:: 1
		- problems on which greedy approach works has two properties:
			- 1. **Greedy - choice property:** a global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.
			  2. **Optimal Substructure: ** An optimal solution to the problem  contains and optimal solution to the subproblems.
	- ## How is it different then [[Dynamic Programming]]
	  heading:: 2
		- Unlike Dynamic Programming, greedy algorithms will never reconsider its choices.
