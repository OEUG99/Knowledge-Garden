- Timestomping is a method used by attackers to alter a file's timestamps, such as when it was last modified, accessed, created, or changed.
	- Think of timestamps as the "stamps" that record the different points in time when something happened to a file.
- By manipulating these stamps, attackers can make it difficult for others to detect unauthorized activity on a file or system.
- This technique can be used to hide malicious activities or to impersonate a user by making it appear as if they accessed or modified a file at a certain time.
