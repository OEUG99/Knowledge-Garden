- he convention was established through a Eurocentric narrative of human progress, even as its signifiers (e.g., rationalism, scientific discovery, technological change) were viewed as unique to the European experience. Such a narrative not only discounts non-European technologies and sciences, including Pacific Islander navigation techniques, but alternative signifiers of being. From this idealized perspective of Eurocentric accounts of progress, the non-European world has been identified as embodying the past

- Meanwhile, net public wealth (state revenues) has declined in almost every country since1980. Thus, in China and Russia, public wealth declined from 60 to 70 percent of national wealth to 20 to 30 percent, and net public wealth has even become negative recently in the United States and the United Kingdom and only slightly positive in Japan, Germany, and France. And the kicker: “this arguably limits government ability to regulate the economy, redistribute income, and mitigate rising inequality.

Mass consumption, theorized as the ultimate goal of development, depends on a dense network of global supply chains delivering raw materials, foodstuffs, and manufactured goods produced with majority world resources (including exploited labor) for the world’s minority with purchasing power (disproportionately in the so-called developed countries).

- While development informed modern narratives in the age of industrialism and empire, it only became formalized as a *project* in the mid-twentieth century. This period was the high tide of decolonization, as the Western (British, Italian, German, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and Belgian) and Japanese empires succumbed to the moral force of anticolonial resistance and when development (associated with independence) became an emancipatory promise. The United States, identifying as a noncolonial power (disregarding its settler-colonial history) and strengthened by its New Deal, by which Keynesian public economic stimulus offered a model of“planned development,” seized the post–World War II moment to proclaim a new (free) world project of development.
