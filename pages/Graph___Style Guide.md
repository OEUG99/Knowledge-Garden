# Namespaces
	- Namespaces should only be used when you are writing for a topic and its tangentially related to specific theme/goal AND it is very unlikely that you will be linking to it from other notes AND you need  notes easily findable.
	- One way you can think of namespaces is like a filling cabinet for related ideas. In the example below, the `[[Film Review]]` namespace acts as a filing cabinet holding all the reviews:
		- **Examples:
			- ```
			  # Correct:
			  [[Film Review]]
			  [[Film Review/Inception]]
			  [[Film Review/Toy Story 3]]
			  
			  You are unlikely to ever link to this page from another page
			  AND your notes are tangentally related.
			  ```
			- ```
			  # Incorrect
			  [[Animals]]
			  [[Animals/Cats]]
			  [[Animals/Dogs/Poodle]]
			  
			  This namespaces theme is not specific enough. Additionally, using it
			  makes using links hard to read.
			  ```
