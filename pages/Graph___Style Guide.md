# Namespaces
	- Namespaces should only be used when you are writing for a topic and its tangentally related to  a broad theme AND it is very unlikely that you will be linking to it from other notes. You can think of namespaces as a filling cabinet for related
		- **Example:**
			- ```
			  # Correct:
			  [[Film Review]]
			  [[Film Review/Inception]]
			  [[Film Review/Toy Story 3]]
			  
			  You are unlikely to ever link to this page from another page
			  AND your notes are tangentally related.
			  ```
