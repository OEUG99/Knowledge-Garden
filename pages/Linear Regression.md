- Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.

	- To calculate best-fit line linear regression uses a traditional slope-intercept form which is given below,
	- **Yi = β0 + β1Xi**
	- where Yi = Dependent variable,  **β0** = constant/Intercept, **β1** = Slope/Intercept, **Xi** = Independent variable.
