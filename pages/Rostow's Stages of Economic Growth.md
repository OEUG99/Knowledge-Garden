- Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth is a model presented by American economist Walt Rostow in 1960. This model postulates that economic growth occurs in five basic stages, of varying length, through which all countries must pass as they advance from a traditional society into a modern, developed one. The model was developed during the Cold War era and reflects a capitalistic view of development.
- The five stages are:
	- ### 1. Traditional Society
	  heading:: 3
		- This is characterized by subsistence farming or hunting and gathering; almost wholly a "primary" sector economy. Social structure is organized under traditional or tribal systems, and technology is limited.
	- ### 2. Preconditions for Take-off
	  heading:: 3
		- This stage involves the development of more productive, commercial agriculture and the initiation of more specialized productionâ€”often through setting up industries like mining. It includes the creation of infrastructure like roads, railways, and ports, as well as improvements in education and healthcare.
	- ### 3. Take-off
	  heading:: 3
		- In this stage, industrialization begins to occur, and workers transfer from agriculture to manufacturing. Economic growth becomes self-sustaining, but not all sectors of the country grow at the same pace. This stage usually lasts for a considerable time period.
	- ### 4. Drive to Maturity
	  heading:: 3
		- In this stage, the economy diversifies into new areas, industries become more efficient, and international trade expands. Skilled professionals emerge, and technological innovation becomes common.
	- ### 5. Age of High Mass Consumption
	  heading:: 3
		- Here, the core of the workforce shifts from manufacturing to services like retail, finance, and other services. Living standards rise, and social welfare services including healthcare and education become widespread.
- Criticism of this model:
	- The model has been criticized for its linear nature, implying that countries must go through each stage in a set sequence. It has also been criticized for its ethnocentric bias, as it was largely based on the experience of Western countries and may not be applicable universally. Critics also note that it does not consider geopolitical factors, social inequality, and environmental degradation.
	- Despite these criticisms, Rostow's model is a foundational concept in the study of economic development and is taught as part of many economics and geography courses.
