# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
	- **BGP** is the core routing protocol of the internet.
- ## Key Features:
	- Policy-based routing.
	- Scalability.
	- ### Two types of BGP:
		- 1. **External BGP (eBGP)**:
			- Between routers in different Autonomous Systems (ASes).
		- 2. **Internal BGP (iBGP)**:
			- Within the same Autonomous System (AS).
- ## How it works:
	- ### 1 - BGP speakers
		- BGP speakers establish sessions (peering) with each other over TCP (Port 179).
	- ### 2 - Route Advertisement:
		- Routers advertise routes to their peers when using BGP.
	- ### 3- Route Withdrawal:
		- If a network is unreachable, BGP announces its withdrawal.
	- ### 4 - Route Aggregation:
		- Used to reduce the number of announced routes.
