# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
- **BGP** is the core routing protocol of the internet.
- ## Key Features:
- Policy-based routing.
- Scalability.
- ## How it works:
- ## **BGP speakers**
	- BGP speakers establish sessions (peering) with each other over TCP (Port 179).
- ## Route Advertisement:
	- Routers advertise routes to their peers when using BGP.
- ## Route Withdrawal:
	- If a network is unreachable, BGP announces its withdrawal.
- ## Route Aggregation:
	- Used to reduce the number of announced routes.
