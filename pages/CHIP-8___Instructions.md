# Standard Chip-8 Instructions
	- ## `0nnn` – SYS addr
		- Jump to a machine code routine at `nnn`.
		- This instruction is only used on the old computers on which Chip-8 was originally implemented. It is ignored by modern interpreters.
	- ## `00E0` – CLS
		- Clear the display.
	- ## `00EE` – RET
		- Return from a subroutine.
		- The interpreter sets the program counter to the address at the top of the stack, then subtracts 1 from the stack pointer.
