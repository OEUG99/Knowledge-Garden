- # CAM Table
	- ## Overview
	- A type of memory used in network switches to store **MAC address-to-port mappings**.
		- ### How it works:
			- When a frame enters the switch, it checks the source MAC address and updates the CAM table with the MAC address and port from where the frame came.
			- It then checks the destination MAC address to determine which port to forward the frame.
	- ## Vulnerability
	- ### CAM Table Overflow:
		- An attack or event where the CAM table of a switch is overwhelmed with fake MAC address entries.
		- This causes the switch to fail in its normal operations.
		- Additionally it typically forces the switch into **flooding mode**, where it broadcasts frames to all ports, which can be exploited for **packet sniffing** or **man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks**.
		- Prevention: Network segmentation, port security, disabled unused ports, better switches have large CAM tables. IDS for monitoring, Sometiems there is flood protection features.
