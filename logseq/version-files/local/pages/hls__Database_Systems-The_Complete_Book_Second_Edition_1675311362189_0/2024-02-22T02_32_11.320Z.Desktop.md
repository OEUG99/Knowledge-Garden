- a) The associative law for union: (R U S) U T = R U (S U T). b) The associative law for intersection: (R ft S) fl T — RC\ (S C\ T). c) The associative law for natural join: (R tx S) ix T = R tx (S tx T). d) The commutative law for union: (R U S) = (S U R). e) The commutative law for intersection: (R fl S) = (S fl R). f) The commutative law for natural join: (R ix S) = (S ex R). g) x l (R U S) = ttl(R) U tti,(S). Here, L is an arbitrary list of attributes. h) The distributive law of union over intersection: R u (S n T) = {R u S) n (R u T)

- In the bag difference R — S, tuple t appears max(0, n — m) times. That is, if tuple t appears in R more times than it appears in S, then t appears in R —S the number of times it appears in R , minus the number of times it appears in S. However, if t appears at least as many times in 5 as it appears in R, then t does not appear at all in R — S. Intuitively, occurrences of t in S each “cancel” one occurrence in R.

- A functional dependency (FD) on a relation R is a statement of the form “If two tuples of R agree on all of the attributes A-i,A2. . . . ,A„ (i.e., the tuples have the same values in their respective components for each of these attributes), then they must also agree on all of another list of attributes B±, B 2 , ■■■, B m. We write this FD formally as Ai A 2 ■■■A n B 1 B 2 ■■■B m and say that“A i , A 2 , ... , A n functionally determine B i, B 2 , . ■■, B m”
