	- Read the pattern once through for an overview
	- Go back and study the Structure, Participants, and Collaborations sections.
	- Look at the Sample Code section to see a concrete example of the pattern in code.
	- Choose names for pattern participants that are meaningful in the application context.
	- Define the classes. Declare their instances, establish their inheritance relationships and define the instance variables that represent data and object references. Identify existing classes in your application that the pattern will affect and modify them accordingly.
	- define application specigic names for operations in the patterm.
		- you might use the "Create-" prefix to consistently denote a factory method.
