- # What is Buddhism?
	- Buddhism is a major world religion founded in ancient India around the 6th century BCE. It is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha (which means "the awakened one").
	- Early Buddhism was influenced by [[Hinduism]] therefore it shares some similarities, as well as some noticeable difference. Like Hinduism, Buddhism is a [[Dharma]] based religion.
	- ## Who is the Buddha?
		- The origins of the Buddha begin with his birth as Prince Siddhartha Gautama, around 563 BCE in Lumbini (Present day Nepal).
		- In attempt to make his son a great king, his father, King Suddhodana, sheltered young Siddhartha from the outside world, containing him to a priviledge life within palace walls shield from suffering and harship.
		- One day, Siddhartha ventured outside the palace and encountered four sights which resulted in him learning about suffering and hardship for the first time:
			- An old man.

			- A dead man

			- A wandering ascetic.

		- Impacted by these sights, he contemplated on the nature of suffering and the impermanence of life, ultimately discovering dissatisfaction for his guarded and  privileged world. This resulted in him leaving his family and nobility behind in a quest for truth and enlightmenet.
		- During this time he practices extreme forms of asceticism, such as severe fasting. Ultimately, he realized that none of these extreme practices progressed him in his quest for  truth and enlightenment.
		- Eventually, Siddhartha took seat under a Bodhi treat in Bodh Gaya, India, and was determined to find his answer through meditation. After 49 days of meditation, Siddhartha obtained enlightenment and became known as the Buddha.

	- ## Core Beliefs
		- **Three Marks of Existence**
			- Viewing the Three Marks as a diagnosis and a disease is a metaphorical way to help understand their role in Buddhism. The three marks describe the nature of all phenomena.
			- The Three Marks of Existence are as follows:
				- **Suffering and Dissatisfaction ([[Dukkha]])**: Dukkha refers to the suffering and dissatisfaction that plagues humane existence. However, it also refers to the discontentment that may arise from the impermanent nature of reality.
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Impermanence (Anicca):**  Anicca refers to the universal truth of impermanence. It suggests that all phenomena are subject to change. Nothing in the world is in a fixed state, such as materials, or even mental. It is about Birth, aging, decay, and death, and how they are core aspects of existence. 
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Anicca can be viewed as a disease in the metaphorical sense..
					  logseq.order-list-type:: number
				- **Non-Self (Anatta)**:  Anatta challenges the idea of an unchanging self, ego, or soul (Atman). It suggests that all phenomena, including the self are devoid of an intrinsic existence; or in other words, what appears to be "me" is neither solid, stable, nor enduring.
