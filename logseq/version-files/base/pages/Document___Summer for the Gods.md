	- ```Darrow snapped it shut by asking, “Now, Mr. Bryan, have you ever pondered what would have happened to the earth if it had stood still?”``` ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=188))
	- ```“Don’t you know it would have been converted into a molten mass of matter?”``` ([Location 193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=193))
	- ```Yet he had conceded the critical point that scripture required interpretation in light of modern science, and he would do so again with the days of creation and the age of the universe.``` ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=196))
	- ```He affirmed his belief in a worldwide flood that killed all life outside the ark (except perhaps the fish, he tried to joke), but interpreted the six days of creation to symbolize vast periods of time.``` ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=212))
	- ```As the inquiry departed ever further from any apparent connection to the Tennessee law against teaching evolution supposedly at issue in the trial, the prosecutor objected, “What is the purpose of this examination?”``` ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=217))
	- ```Darrow answered honestly. “We have the purpose of preventing bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United States,” he declared, “and that is all.”``` ([Location 219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=219))
	- ```Bryan had come to defend the power of local majorities to enact a law—his law—to ban teaching about human evolution in public schools.``` ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=223))
	- ```No one cared about the defendant, John Scopes, who had volunteered to test the nation’s first antievolution statute.``` ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=225))
	- ```At the time, the popular debate over the status of evolution as science centered largely on the interpretation of fossils.``` ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=243))
	- ```but short of actually observing the development of new kinds of plants or animals, intermediate fossils linking related species offered the most persuasive “proof” of evolution.``` ([Location 244](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=244))
	- ```“It would not be true to say that the evolution of man rests upon evidence as complete as that of the horse,”``` ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=249))
	- ```This chain of human ancestors was totally unknown to Darwin. He could not have even dreamed of such a flood of proof and truth.”``` ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=253))
	- ```“What he wants is that his ideas, his interpretations and beliefs should be made mandatory. When Mr. Darrow talks of bigotry he talks of that. Bigotry seeks to make opinions and beliefs mandatory.”``` ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=264))
	- ```These pieces carried tremendous potential significance. Owing to its size and shape, the cranium clearly came from a hominid. The flint tools reinforced this conclusion.``` ([Location 289](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=289))
	- ```“The evidence was clear that this discovery revealed a missing link between man and the higher apes.”``` ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=303))
	- ```the New York Times published a summary of Dawson and Woodward’s initial presentation within hours of the event.``` ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=306))
	- ```A day later, the Times followed up with a telegraphic interview of Woodward. “Hitherto the nearest approach to a species from which we might have been said to descend that had been discovered was the cave-man,”``` ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=308))
	- ```This peculiar editorial disavowing a scientific news report reflected the divided mind of the American public,``` ([Location 324](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=324))
	- ```Yet it fit into a larger pattern. During the first quarter of the twentieth century, scientists in western Europe and the United States accumulated an increasingly persuasive body of evidence supporting a Darwinian view of human origins, and``` ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=327))
	- ```These scientific developments helped set the stage in the early 1920s for a massive crusade by fundamentalists against teaching evolution in public schools, which culminated in the 1925 trial of John Scopes.``` ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=329))
	- ```This research drove him to acknowledge that the earth had a very long geologic history, far longer than suggested by a literal interpretation of the account in Genesis,``` ([Location 344](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=344))
	- ```Sudden breaks that appeared in the fossil record in which one characteristic group abruptly replaced an earlier one with few transitional forms, coupled with a conviction that living species were too complex to evolve, led Cuvier to conclude that great catastrophes such as worldwide floods or ice ages punctuated geologic history into a series of distinct epochs.``` ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=346))
	- ```For Christians, this posed a conflict with the account in Genesis, which declared that God formed the heavens, the earth, and all kinds of living things in six days, culminating in the creation of Adam and Eve as the forebears of all human beings.``` ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=354))
	- ```geologists as Amherst College president Edward Hitchcock and Yale’s James D. Dana reconciled contemporary geological opinion with their traditional religious beliefs by interpreting the biblical days of creation as symbolizing geologic ages or, alternatively, by positing a gap in the Genesis account.``` ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=358))
	- ```Even the Scofield Reference Bible, which profoundly influenced the development of modern fundamentalism around the turn of the twentieth century, incorporated the “gap theory” into its explanation of Genesis and referred to the “day/age theory” in a footnote. 11``` ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=362))
	- ```The high school textbook at issue in the Scopes trial, George William Hunter’s A Civic Biology, summarized Darwin’s alternative evolutionary mechanism in a section entitled “Charles Darwin and Natural Selection.”``` ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=372))
	- ```Beneficial variation was random and natural selection was cruel. If nature reflected the character of its creator, then the God of a Darwinian world acted randomly and cruelly. Darwin could not accept such a God, and became an agnostic. Others recognized the magnitude of the issue.``` ([Location 392](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=392))
	- ```Charles Hodge took the lead in challenging Darwinism. His provocatively titled 1874 book What is Darwinism? presented a tightly reasoned argument that led to the inevitable answer: “It is atheism [and] utterly inconsistent with the Scriptures.” For Hodge, Darwin’s “denial of design in nature is virtually the denial of God.”``` ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=405))
	- ```If organic evolution occurred (and by 1880 most naturalists believed that it did), then some mechanism must accelerate and direct variation; for some devout Christians, this left a role for God.``` ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=417))
	- ```Orr asserted that evolution was “coming to be recognized as but a new name for ‘creation.’” Based on this endorsement for theistic evolution, Orr could confidently proclaim, “Here, again, the Bible and science are felt in harmony.”``` ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=464))
	- ```By the turn of the century, secular historians and essayists rather than theologians and scientists were largely responsible for keeping alive the public perception of hostility between Christians and evolutionists.``` ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=467))
	- ```During the years leading up to the Scopes trial, this reaction inspired an outpouring of academic books, articles, and essays discussing the conflict between science and religion, with an increasing focus on the seemingly pivotal issue of Darwinism.``` ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=486))
	- ```one commentator wrote that Darwin’s theory “seemed to promise the greatest victory ever yet won by science over theology.” To another, it “constituted the final and irresistible onslaught of science on the old view as to the nature of Biblical authority.”37``` ([Location 488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=488))
	- ```By 1925, the warfare model of science and religion had become ingrained into the received wisdom of many secular Americans.``` ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=493))
	- ```defense co-counsel Arthur Garfield Hays told reporters, “Of all the books I have read for this trial, the ‘Warfare Between Science and Religion [sic],’ by Prof. White, is, to my mind, one of the most interesting and readable.” He quoted from this book in the course of his legal argument in Dayton and distributed it to at least some of the people that he met there .41``` ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=498))
	- ```Darwin historian James R. Moore described this renewed controversy: “Fifty years it had taken for the teaching of evolution to filter into the high schools, for the high schools to reach the people, and for the people—those, at any rate, who became militant Fundamentalists—to belong to a generation who could not remember the evangelical evolutionists among its ancestors.”43``` ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=508))
	- ```Moore identified two different causes for the timing of the antievolution crusade here. First, Darwinism did not become a fighting matter for many fundamentalists until it began to influence their children’s education in the twenties. Second, Christian biologists at that time could not so readily step in, as they had earlier, to soften evolution’s impact on religious belief.``` ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=511))
	- ```Largely due to developments in experimental genetics, biologists increasingly accepted random, inborn variation as the driving force for evolutionary change and rejected the Lamarckian-type explanations``` ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=513))
	- ```Evolutionary theory did not suddenly appear in American high school education at the time of the antievolution crusade; it had been incorporated into leading textbooks during the late nineteenth century, but with a theistic or Lamarckian twist that reflected prevailing scientific opinion.``` ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=516))
	- ```Textbooks typically became more Darwinian in the new century, however, especially after the newly organized field of biology began to replace separate courses on botany and zoology in the high school curriculum.``` ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=522))
	- ```This increase resulted in part from tougher Progressive-era school attendance laws that forced more teenagers to go to school, and followed also from greater access to secondary education, as the number of public high schools increased dramatically during the early part of the century.49``` ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=538))
	- ```Governor Austin Peay—who signed the state’s antievolution bill into law—boasted in his 1925 inaugural address, “High schools have sprung up throughout the state which are the pride of their communities.”50 This was certainly true for Dayton, site of that year’s Scopes trial, which opened its first public high school in 1906.51 These new schools inevitably included Darwinian concepts in their biological classes, in line with modern developments in American scientific thought.``` ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=541))
	- ```“Mr. Bryan did not even know that evolution takes place ... in the hereditary units called ‘genes.’ ... Morgan and his students ... have adduced evidence that these genes are themselves the subject of change. And if these genes can be proved to change ... then, the case for evolution is absolutely won.”55``` ([Location 569](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=569))
	- ```Many Americans associated Darwinian natural selection, as it applied to people, with a survival-of-the-fittest mentality that justified laissez-faire capitalism, imperialism, and militarism.``` ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=590))
	- ```Decades before the crusade, for example, Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller, Sr., claimed this as justification for their cutthroat business practices.``` ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=591))
	- ```During the years immediately preceding the antievolution crusade, a scientific-sounding form of these social doctrines gained widespread public attention under the name eugenics.``` ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=594))
	- ```Typically justifying their actions on the basis of evolutionary biology and genetics, by 1935, thirty-five states enacted laws to compel the sexual segregation and sterilization of certain persons viewed as eugenically unfit, particularly the mentally ill and retarded, habitual criminals, and epileptics.``` ([Location 604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=604))
	- ```Everywhere the public debate over eugenics colored people’s thinking about the theory of human evolution.``` ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=612))
	- ```Popular evangelist Billy Sunday, for example, repeatedly linked eugenics with teaching evolution during his 1925 Memphis crusade, which coincided with legislative consideration of the Tennessee antievolution bill.``` ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=613))
	- ```Such prominent eugenicists as A. E. Wiggam recognized a tie between antievolutionism and opposition to eugenics.``` ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=618))
	- ```“For the production of man a different apprenticeship was needed to sharpen the wits and quicken the higher manifestations of intellect.... Southern Africa, by providing a vast open country with occasional wooded belts and a relative scarcity of water, together with a fierce and bitter mammalian competition, furnished a laboratory such as was essential to this penultimate phase of human evolution.”71 In``` ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=644))
	- ```Many other antievolutionists did the same. Less than two months after Dart’s announcement, a New York newspaper reported, “Professor Dart’s theory that the Taungs skull is a missing link has evidently not convinced the legislature of Tennessee, the governor of which state has signed an ‘Anti-Evolution’ Bill which forbids the teaching ... that man is descended from lower order of animals.”73``` ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=657))
	- ```“The evolutionists have attempted to prove by circumstantial evidence (resemblances) that man is descended from the brute,” he declared in a 1923 address to the West Virginia state legislature.``` ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=679))
	- ```Conservative theologians at the Presbyterian seminary in Princeton added a formal theory of biblical inerrancy, leading their denomination to adopt a five-point declaration of essential doctrines that became central tenets of fundamentalism: the absolute accuracy and divine inspiration of scripture, the virgin birth of Christ, salvation solely through Christ’s sacrifice, the bodily resurrection of Christ and his followers, and the authenticity of biblical miracles.``` ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=699))
	- ```Conservative Christians drew together across denominational lines to fight for the so-called fundamentals of their traditional faith against the perceived heresy of modernism, and in so doing gave birth to the fundamentalist movement and antievolution crusade.``` ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=724))
	- ```“When the Church is regarded as the body of God-fearing, righteous-living men, then, it ought to be in politics, and as a powerful influence,” he proclaimed in a 1906 book that urged Christians to promote social justice for the urban poor and workers.12``` ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=754))
	- ```Fundamentalism began as a response to theological developments within the Protestant church rather than to political or educational developments within American society.``` ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=774))
	- ```Bryan warned in one of his popular books, “Nietzsche carried Darwinism to its logical conclusion and denied the existence of God, denounced Christianity as the doctrine of the degenerate, and democracy as the refuge of the weakling; he overthrew all standards of morality and eulogized war as necessary to man’s development.”23``` ([Location 847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=847))
	- ```“What shall it profit a man if he shall gain all the learning of the schools and lose his faith in God?”25 This became his ultimate justification for the Scopes trial.``` ([Location 858](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=858))
	- ```“The movement will sweep the country, and we will drive Darwinism from our schools,” he wrote to the resolution’s sponsor. “We have all the Elijahs on our side. Strength to your arms.”36 Bryan had identified his political objective. Within the month, he was on the spot in Lexington, addressing a joint session of the Kentucky legislature on the proposal. Bryan then spent the next month touring the state in support of such legislation, which lost by a single vote in the state House of Representatives.``` ([Location 906](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=906))
	- ```By the thirties, he warned of an “international Jewish-Bolshevik-Darwinist conspiracy” to promote evolutionism in the classroom, and praised Adolph Hitler’s effort to foil such conspiracies in Germany.41``` ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=928))
	- ```Bryan’s popular arguments shaped the prosecution’s case in Dayton. “Teachers in public schools must teach what the taxpayers desire taught,” the Commoner admonished the West Virginia legislature in 1923. “The hand that writes the pay check rules the school.”42``` ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=932))
	- ```“If it is contended that an instructor has a right to teach anything he likes, I reply that the parents who pay the salary have a right to decide what shall be taught,” Bryan maintained.48 “A scientific soviet is attempting to dictate what is taught in our schools,” he warned. “It is the smallest, the most impudent, and the most tyrannical oligarchy that ever attempted to exercise arbitrary power.”49``` ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=946))
	- ```He gave a similarly facile response to charges that antievolution laws infringed on the rights of nonfundamentalist parents and students.``` ([Location 950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=950))
	- ```“The Christians who want to teach religion in their schools furnish the money for denominational institutions. If atheists want to teach atheism, why do they not build their own schools and employ their own teachers?”50 Such a position assumed that the separation of church and state precluded teaching the Genesis account in public schools.``` ([Location 952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=952))
	- ```In his crusade to rally the people against teaching evolution, Bryan was nearly omnipresent. He gave hundreds of speeches on the topic to audiences across the country, including major addresses to nine different state legislatures in the South and Midwest.``` ([Location 968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=968))
	- ```The legislatures of six different southern and border states actively considered antievolution proposals during the spring of 1923, with Bryan personally involved in most instances, but only two minor measures passed.``` ([Location 988](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=988))
	- ```The Florida legislature chimed in with a nonbinding resolution declaring “that it is improper and subversive to the best interest of the people” for public school teachers “to teach as true Darwinism or any other hypothesis that links man in blood relationship to any form of lower life.”60``` ([Location 991](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=991))
	- ```The Florida resolution was important because Bryan suggested its language and later claimed that it reflected his “views” on the issue, with one significant exception. “Please note,” he explained, “that the objection is not to teaching the evolutionary hypothesis as a hypothesis, but to the teaching of it as true or as a proven fact.”61``` ([Location 995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=995))
	- ```Bryan asked that Florida legislators outlaw such teaching, however, rather than simply to denounce it as improper; but even on this point, the trusting Commoner added, “I do not think that there should be any penalty attached to the bill.``` ([Location 1001](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1001))
	- ```We are not dealing with a criminal class.”63 Cautious legislators in Bryan’s adopted state compromised by unanimously passing an advisory resolution rather than a law, thereby avoiding any risk of a lawsuit over their action.``` ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1003))
	- ```Two years later, Tennessee legislators displayed less caution than their Florida counterparts—and less trust in teachers than Bryan—by opting for a criminal law on the subject, including a penalty provision, and applying it to all teaching about human evolution rather than solely to teaching it as true.``` ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1005))
	- ```Proposals to outlaw teaching evolution were the real target of this editorial, just as they prompted the Commercial Appeal to defend Bryan’s “honestly accumulated” wealth and publicize his angry denial, “I am not a millionaire.”70``` ([Location 1037](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1037))
	- ```“in the introduction of a bill in the Legislature by Senator [John A.] Shelton of Savannah to make it a felony to teach evolution in the public schools of the state.”``` ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1043))
	- ```“If we are to exist as a nation the principles upon which our Government is founded must not be destroyed, which they surely would be if ... we set the Bible aside as being untrue and put evolution in its place.”``` ([Location 1046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1046))
	- ```Butler was a little-known Democratic farmer-legislator and Primitive Baptist lay leader. For him, public schools served to promote citizenship based on biblical concepts of morality. Evolutionary beliefs undermined those concepts. Driven by such reasoning, Butler proposed making it a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum fine of $500, for a public school teacher “to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man had descended from a lower order of animal.”74``` ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1048))
	- ```The House action reflected overwhelming support for the general concept of limits on teaching evolution rather than any detailed consideration of the pending legislation, which Butler had drafted himself.``` ([Location 1055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1055))
	- ```Bryan’s 1924 Nashville speech, which did not offer any specific legislative proposal other than to proclaim that if Christians “cannot teach the views of the majority in the schools supported by taxation, then a few people cannot teach at public expense their scientific interpretation that attacks every vital principle of Christianity.”75 Bryan’s Florida antievolution resolution expressly incorporated this seemingly balanced restriction on teaching any theory of origins, but Butler’s bill dealt solely with the theory of evolution—and the distinction between the two positions was never discussed by Tennessee legislators.``` ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1057))
	- ```The speedy House action apparently caught the public off guard. No letters to the editor for or against the Butler bill appeared in any major newspaper of the state prior to the House vote. A deluge of letters followed that action.``` ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1074))
	- ```teaching of Billy Bryan, Billy Sunday and all the rest.”79 Comparisons to Galileo’s trial and Bruno’s execution were commonplace. “I fear we will never stamp out the evolution theory, for old Bruno was burned and old Galileo thrown in prison,” a sarcastic writer protested, “and yet the damnable round earth theory is still being taught.”80 The``` ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1086))
	- ```Already, the three main tactics for attacking the antievolution measure had emerged: the defense of individual freedom, an appeal to scientific authority, and a mocking ridicule of fundamentalists and biblical literalism; later, they became the three prongs of the Scopes defense.``` ([Location 1110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1110))
	- ```Bryan declined this invitation but offered one suggestion on the bill. “The special thing that I want to suggest is that it is better not to have a penalty,” he advised. “In the first place, our opponents, not being able to oppose the measure on its merits, are always trying to find something that will divert attention, and the penalty furnishes the excuse.... The second reason is that we are dealing with an educated class that is supposed to respect the law.”97 With no penalty, of course, there would be no martyrs to the cause of freedom—and no Scopes trial—simply obstinate schoolteachers flaunting the public will. Bryan could foresee the public relations impact of both courses.``` ([Location 1140](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1140))
	- ```“It isn’t a question of whether you believe in the Book of Genesis, but whether you think the church and state should be kept separate,” one senator asserted.``` ([Location 1190](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005ERZLGC&location=1190))
