- # What are the laws of motion?
	- These laws lay the foundation for classical mechanics, which is tremendously successful in explaining and predicting the behavior of objects in our everyday experiences and in scientific experiments.
- ##  First law of Motion: the Law of Inertia.
	- This law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion, with the same direction and speed, unless acted upon by a non-zero net force.
- ## Second Law of Motion: The Law of Acceleration.
- It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and is inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of the acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force. This is often condensed into the formula: F = ma, where F represents force, m represents mass, and a represents acceleration.
- ## Newton's Third Law: The Law of Action-Reaction.
	- According to this law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This principle means that any force exerted on a body will create a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the object that exerted the first force.
