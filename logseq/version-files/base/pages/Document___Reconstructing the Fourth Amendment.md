	- Yet even this history seemed incomplete to me, for the original Fourth Amendment, as ratified in 1791—indeed the entire original Bill of Rights—applied only to the federal government, not to the states. It was one of the functions of the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, to apply or “incorporate” ([Location 82](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=82))

	- ```md
	- Absent a citizen′s voluntary consent, all police activity involves violence or its threat. A “search” is by definition an unwanted, thus forced, invasion of a reasonable expectation of privacy. A “seizure” similarly is an unwanted interference with a person′s freedom of movement or his possessory interest in property. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=139))

	- ```
	- ```md
	- This last point is implicit in both the Lockean social contract and republican virtue theories that animated the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and form the backdrop for understanding the real meaning of the Fourth Amendment. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=154))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The “public” or “common good” is the good of all the People, not of any subset or elite, preserving both the People′s safety and their existence as “a People.” ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=165))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The kind of state force involved in stops, arrests, searches, and seizures is therefore necessary to the very existence of a People and of a state. ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=166))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Yet Lockean liberals are simultaneously distrustful of the state, fearful that it will use its awesome force to serve factions rather than the People as a whole, imposing tyrannical rule in ways both large and small. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=167))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The state′s use of force must therefore be monitored and tamed by the People or by institutions legitimately acting on their behalf. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=168))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The Fourth Amendment′s declaration that the state use force to effect “searches and seizures” only when “reasonable” is sensibly understood as constitutionalizing the mandate that the People tame state power.10 ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=169))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Republican (as opposed to liberal) theory likewise recognized that the state must serve the common good rather than that of a faction. But the common good can be discerned only by virtuous citizens shaping a virtuous state and vice versa. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=171))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Yet those Framers most heavily influenced by republican thinking still accepted that this political conversation could successfully be undertaken only in the context of a neo-Lockean social contract. ([Location 174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=174))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- For republicans, however, that contract was political, in the sense that it required institutions to encourage the sense of shared values necessary to an effectively functioning People. Only such a united People could tame otherwise unbridled state violence. For republicans too, therefore, the Fourth Amendment channels state force to productive purposes. ([Location 176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=176))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- For both liberals and republicans, the use of state violence to enforce the laws—modernly, the function of the police—is thus a necessary precondition to Peoplehood and to social stability. ([Location 178](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=178))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The Fourth Amendment is best understood, or so this book will argue, as just such an attempt to tame political violence, ensuring its service to the “security” of a free People by prohibiting unreasonable exercises of the state′s use of force. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=182))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- It was a world in which objectionable warrants were often issued by provincial governors or by legislatures—either colonial ones or by the British Parliament—rather than by judges; ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=414))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- which the fear of abusive searches and seizures focused on the tax man, British soldiers, and British impressment gangs “recruiting” for the Royal Navy rather than on organized police forces, which did not yet exist. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=417))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Whether the relevant events took place in England or America, search and seizure disputes were understood by the Framing generation as quintessentially tied to political violence in the long contest with England. ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=420))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Thus, after a famously influential Revolutionary leader, James Otis, rose to protest the writs of assistance—a form of general warrant permitting certain searches and seizures without individualized suspicion or a particularized description of the persons or things to be seized ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=423))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- “Commencement of the Controversy between Great Britain and America,” and virtually all modern historians agree at least that violent resistance to the writs, and Britain′s equally violent response, were major causes of the American Revolution.2 ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=427))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The abusive searches and seizures that captured colonial Americans’ attention frequently involved state efforts to suppress dissent. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=434))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Among the most striking of the early prosecutions during the colonial period was that of Sir Edward Coke, author of the Institutes of the Laws of England, one of the major works of the common-law tradition. Coke, along with Robert Beale, clerk of the Privy Council in 1589, and Sir William Matthew Hale, another “celebrated authority on the common law” and the influential author of the History of the Pleas of the Crown, “invented a rhetorical tradition against general searches” that would eventually culminate in the Fourth Amendment. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=436))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Jefferson praised him, and Americans admired him as “the foremost authority on English law.” Coke was also one of the Crown′s most influential opponents.5 ([Location 441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=441))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Notably, Privy Council warrants were issued “for the searching and sealing of the trunks, studies, cabinets, and other repositories of papers” of leading figures after they had given “insurrectionary speeches” in Parliament. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=443))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Coke′s turn came in 1634, while he was on his deathbed. In an effort to ferret out seditious papers believed to be in circulation among the Crown′s opponents, the Privy Council sent a messenger to Coke′s home bearing an order to search for “seditious and dangerous papers.” His chambers were ransacked, his writings (including the manuscripts of his great legal works) seized, his jewelry and money carried away.6 ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=445))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- 1754 Massachusetts Provincial Legislature′s enactment of an excise tax. The excise legislation “authorized tax collectors to interrogate any subject, under oath, on the amount of rum, wine, and other spirits he had consumed in his private premises in the past year and taxed it by the gallon.” ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=449))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The seditious-libel prosecution probably most influential on colonial thinking about search and seizure took place in England in 1763 and involved Parliamentary member John Wilkes. Wilkes anonymously published the North Briton series of pamphlets, including Number 45. Number 45 contained unusually bitter insults to a speech given by the king′s ministers that defended an unpopular 1763 excise tax on cider in which the authorizing legislation granted extensive powers to search in aid of law enforcement. ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=474))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Huckle v. Money, Chief Justice Pratt charged the jury, “To enter a man′s house by virtue of a nameless warrant, in order to procure evidence, is worse than the Spanish Inquisition, a law under which no Englishman would wish to live an hour.” The jury awarded the plaintiffs the substantial sum of three hundred pounds in damages. Huckle established the principle that Crown officers engaging in unlawful searches are liable for damages in trespass and false-imprisonment suits. ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=490))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Wilkes became a popular idol, the “personification of constitutional liberty to Englishmen on both sides of the Atlantic.” “Wilkes and Liberty” became a patriot′s slogan in America. Wilkes became linked to Americans’ struggles for liberty when, evoking shades of Parliament′s reaction to North Briton Number 45, the New York Assembly (the province′s lower house) “stopped at nothing” to get the name of a citizen who had assailed that House for approving provisions for the king′s troops in 1769. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=514))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- first, general warrants for arrest were condemned in all cases; second, general warrants to search for papers were condemned only if issued by the executive in seditious-libel cases; third, Secretarial or executiveissued warrants otherwise remained legal; and, fourth, the elaborate system of warrantless and general searches authorized by statute remained intact. ([Location 527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=527))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The bottom line was that “even promiscuously general searches did not violate the liberty of the subject or infringe the maxim about a man′s home [being his castle] so long as Parliament had laid down the law.”21 ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=530))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Americans during the Revolutionary War had used promiscuous searches and seizures to silence dissent, even harassing those who, on religious grounds, refused to take loyalty oaths. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=537))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The outlines of modern free-speech notions only started to become visible with Thomas Jefferson′s election to the presidency in 1800, partly as a result of popular rejection of Federalist Party prosecutions of dissenters under the Alien and Sedition Acts. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=539))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- It was in the nineteenth-century contest between slavers and abolitionists that robust free-speech protections eventually came to take root.23 ([Location 541](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=541))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- the seditious-libel examples that I have chosen illustrate the close connection between search-and-seizure and free-speech principles from an early stage in the American story. Violent state invasions of privacy, property, and locomotion were used, and understood to be used, to suppress dissent, even if ideas of what dissent was inappropriately “licentious” were still immature. Both search-and-seizure and free-speech rights needed vigor if either were to prosper.24 ([Location 542](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=542))

	- The Sugar Act had expanded the juryless vice-admiralty courts’ jurisdiction, courts “despised for circumventing juries, one of the traditional ‘pillars’ of the people′s liberty.” ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=560))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- to keep peace with the French and Indians and regulate squatters, smugglers, and bandits, the British government decided to maintain a standing army in America during peacetime, an army double the size of the one in the colonies before the Seven Years’ War. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=563))

	- Rhode Island′s assembly declared the act unconstitutional, and by October 1765 delegates from nine colonies formed a “Stamp Act Congress,” which vehemently denied by formal declaration Parliament′s right to tax them.29 ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=581))

Considering such evidence in connection with the probable-cause determination seems to violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination—a point made by Pringle in his brief but thoroughly ignored in the Court′s opinion. Pringle thus faced a variation on the “cruel trilemma” that the privilege seeks to prevent: admit to the crime, resulting in your arrest and likely conviction; deny the crime, thus committing the offense of obstructing justice and again facing arrest; or remain silent, your reticence itself counting as evidence of your guilt and thus, yet again, resulting in your arrest.

Indeed, though not using the term “moral sense” in this connection, proslavery writers effectively embraced the vision of blacks as devoid of moral sense. “[T]he Negro was by nature a savage brute,” according to Southern racial ideology, but “Under slavery,…he was ‘domesticated’ or, to ([Location 2867](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004DNW5YO&location=2867))
