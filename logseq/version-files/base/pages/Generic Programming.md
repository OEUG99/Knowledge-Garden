	- Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later that are instantiated when needed for specific types provided as parameters.  This approach permits writing common functions or types that differ only in the set of types on which they operate when used, thus reducing duplication.
		- instantiated: refers to the creation of an object.
