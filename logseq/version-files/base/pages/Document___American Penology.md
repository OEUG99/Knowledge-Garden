	- ```md
	- In the first half of the twentieth century, criminological inquiry was focused upon offender behavior and crime causation. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=90))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- it was assumed that this system simply operates in accordance with its formally prescribed goals and purposes. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=92))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- As public scrutiny increased, problems emerged that were directly connected to the underlying goals and fundamental purposes of the criminal justice system. ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=95))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- “blind justice” and “disin terested professionalism” ([Location 96](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=96))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Research shifted from a fixation with the offender and causes of crime to a preoccupation with the meaning and consequences of past and present crime-control efforts. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=99))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- One dominant theme is what Cohen (1985) termed the “demystification theme of penology,” which resulted from critical examinations of the ideas and consequences of various penal strategies. ([Location 101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=101))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- For example, some assert that this disparity is due to flawed implementation resulting from misunderstandings in program design, in sufficient resources and staff, or other unforeseen developmental impediments (ibid.). ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=106))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Others maintain that the disparity between ideas and consequences is not so accidental; ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=107))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- There are no unintended (negative) consequences associated with penal reform, just traditional political and economic imperatives and interests being fulfilled. ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=110))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- According to this theme—depending upon the needs of the labor market—the prison effectively functions as a factory by manufacturing disciplined and reliable workers, or as a warehouse controlling a surplus population of workers who threaten the existing social and economic order (Melossi and Pavarini, 1981; Rusche and Kirchheimer, 1939). ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=114))

	- ```md
	- The American colonial period spanned nearly two hundred years, beginning with the establishment of Virginia in 1607, and concluding after the American Revolution. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=261))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Friedman (1993) noted, the physical and social circumstances of colonial life (e.g., starvation, Indian hostility, internal dissent) “bent the English pat terns out of shape.” ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=264))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- There was a genuine fear that men and women might overindulge in the liberties of the New World and become “worse than brute beasts” (quoted in ibid.). ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=267))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The English common law system established the practices of oral testimony, a jury of peers, and the classification of offenses. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=270))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- criminal codes in colonial America were generally more lenient than in England, ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=273))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Colonies developed their own ideas about crime and punishment based on their specific religious beliefs and immediate surroundings. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=274))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- in all colonies, public and physical punishments of various types were the norm. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=278))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Colonial society was organized around the three primary institutions of community, church, and family. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=281))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Community cohesion and order were also facilitated by the establishment of small, closely knit communities. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=284))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Community order was equally secured through a culturally and spiritually prescribed hierarchy of authority. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=292))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- colonial authorities modeled their role after stern fathers, seeking to mend the ways of their wayward children. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=296))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Towns, like families, were responsible for their own, and permanent residence was critical in establishing a good reputation. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=297))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- outsiders were feared and resisted because they posed a potential threat to the stability of the community. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=298))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- most colonies enacted settlement laws to exclude outsiders. ([Location 299](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=299))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In order to survive and thrive, communities needed to remain small and be founded on a shared faith and cooperation ([Location 305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=305))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The religious screening of outsiders would seem to contradict the very reason for establishing the new world. ([Location 306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=306))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Religion was clearly the salt that flavored colonial life and it permeated every aspect of life ([Location 311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=311))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In eighteenth-century America, religion entered into all discourse, marked all observations, and gave meaning to every private and public crisis—crime included ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=319))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- in colonial America, there was little if any distinction between crime and sin. ([Location 320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=320))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Crime, like any sin, was a predictable consequence of a fallen world and the active forces of the devil. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=323))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Colonists were additionally mindful of behaviors that would unduly burden the community. For example, colonists were not preoccupied with sexual offenses solely because of their moral implications; they were concerned with the influence of illicit sexual activity on the well being of the community. ([Location 342](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=342))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Out of deference to community, criminal codes were also used to control prices and wages and it was unlawful for merchants to gain unreasonable profits through the sale of goods. ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=345))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Although criminal codes clearly existed, what constituted illegal behavior also could be determined on a situational basis (Norton, 1991). ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=351))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Legislators of the day purposely penned broad statutes, assuming that specificity was not required because everyone shared the same norms and values ([Location 352](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=352))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- because there was a general consensus on what constituted criminal behavior, at least among those of English descent, establishing a meticulous comprehensive system of laws was not as crucial to social order. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=358))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- For example, while a law might declare a certain behavior to be criminal, it would go unreported and therefore unpunished if the community viewed it as harmless. ([Location 360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=360))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Conversely, if no law existed for behavior the community found reprehensible (e.g., severe child beating), then members of the community would seek remedy together (ibid.) ([Location 361](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=361))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Historical records show that fornication, lewd behavior, drunkenness, petty theft, assaults, and Lord's Day violations were the most frequently prosecuted crimes (Powers, 1966). ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=365))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Women most often were charged with the offenses of witchcraft, fornication, bastardy, and infanticide ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=368))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Given the close-knit existence of colonial towns, there was little need for day-to-day surveillance of possible wrongdoing. ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=374))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- colonists were, in effect, self-policed. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=375))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- informal social control precluded the need for formal law enforcement, ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=376))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- When the informal social control mechanisms of family, community, and church failed, colonists employed relatively harsh punishments. ([Location 378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=378))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- it was not unusual for crimes committed by non-community members to be treated more harshly than those committed by community members. ([Location 380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=380))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- This disparity in colonial responses to offenders reflects the classic distinction between welfare-oriented reactions to rule breaking by in-group community members and punishment-oriented reactions to deviating outsiders. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=382))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The purpose of punishment was, in the end, primarily retributive: The punishment of crime (i.e., sin) was necessary, regardless of effectiveness, because it was morally right and deserved. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=389))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Fines were by far the most frequently imposed sanction and were used nearly three times as often as corporal punishment. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=391))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- As a matter of practice, fines were primarily reserved for the propertied class. Those without property—namely, slaves—had their period of servitude extended or were whipped. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=394))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Because everyone has a body, few people escaped some form of corporal punishment in their lifetime. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=398))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Servants, slaves, and women were particularly vulnerable to whippings because they lacked the money or property to pay fines. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=402))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Fining a woman usually meant fining her husband. To ensure that the woman was the one punished, judges resorted to whipping ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=403))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- officials were often reluctant to impose economic penalties on widows or single women, concerned that their estates or dependent children might be harmed as a result ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=404))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Some colonies employed biblical scripture as a type of sentencing guideline. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=410))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Colonists also relied on banishment and various shaming techniques as methods of punishment. Banishment usually was reserved for non-community members, recidivists, and other offenders viewed as permanent dangers. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=414))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- When imposed, these shaming punishments exposed the offender to verbal and physical abuse (pelting with stones, rotten fruit, or mud) by community passers-by. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=426))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Rather than subduing the offender and encouraging repentance, shaming often had the opposite effect: The public ridicule often drove the offender to beg, swear, and insult spectators ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=427))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Colonists employed harsh measures for recidivists, including death and what, for lack of a better term, can be called “shock” death. In the case of shock death, an offender would receive a sentence of death by hanging but later would be granted a reprieve. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=429))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The sentence of actual death by hanging could apply to recidivists, murderers, arsonists, horse thieves, and incorrigible youth. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=434))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Though executions were relatively infrequent events, they were not meaningless or private events. High-profile cases were particularly likely to draw large crowds. Those in attendance might even have traveled long distances to witness the execution. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=442))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The execution scene was also intended to be a “deeply spiritual experience for all those who witnessed” it (Friedman, 1993). ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=444))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In colonial America, jails were of little significance and were unremarkable in appearance. Architecturally, they resembled any other house or building and were located within the main parameters of the community. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=455))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In an attempt to mimic family routines, the keeper (i.e., warden) was expected to be married and his family, along with the offend ers, resided under one roof. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=457))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Offenders were required to pay for their keep, and there was little or no attempt to separate offenders by gender, age, or offense severity: Vagrants, prostitutes, runaway servants and slaves, disobedient apprentices, juvenile delinquents, the insane, prisoners of war, and religious offenders all were detained together; women and children were detained with men and others who had committed violent crimes ([Location 459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=459))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- there were few or no security measures to pre vent escapes. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=462))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- jails were not envisioned as a primary punishment or as a place of rehabilitation. Instead, they were used most commonly as holding places for offenders awaiting trial or punishment. ([Location 463](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=463))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- jails were seen primarily a way of “prying open their purses” (Kann, 2005). ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=464))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Almshouses and workhouses functioned as alternatives to jail for the relief of the poor and those segments of the population that were not quite criminal. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=466))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Though colonial communities were no doubt quaint in certain respects, they were also rigid in a way that made life demanding and difficult. In particular, severe punishment awaited anyone who strayed from cultural norms or social and religious authorities. ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=478))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In a harsh and unfamiliar new world, family, community, economic necessity, and religion contributed to a social context in which specific punishment ideas and practices were viewed as necessary and appropriate. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=480))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Punishment in colonial America was overwhelmingly public and physical. It emphasized the condemnation of sin and disobedience, and ultimately repentance through shaming and humiliation. Punishment also was considered to be a moral obligation of the community. To neglect this obligation was a sin itself, equally subject to the displeasure of God. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=481))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- After 1790, the pillars of colonial existence gave way to a new social, cultural, and political order. As the American landscape changed geographically, demographically, and economically, so too did ideas about crime and punishment. The American Revolution heralded the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, westward expansion, and the era of penal modernity. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=489))

	- ```md
	- reformers were already starting to question capital punishment and the conditions in colonial jails, and began to express mixed views if not outright opposition to physical and public punishments. ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=492))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Between 1790 and 1830, the new republic experienced rapid and marked social changes that culminated in what is now referred to as modernity. ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=496))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The social norms and values consistent with scientific reason, capitalism, free markets, democracy, and egalitarianism were established during this period and are regarded as the hallmarks of the modern age. ([Location 497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=497))

	- ```md
	- Nationhood also established a “centralizing presence” that was absent in colonial America. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=498))

	- ```md
	- federal laws—seventeen crimes against the new federal government were enacted in 1790—as well as the development of postal, roadway, lighthouse, and navigational systems. ([Location 499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=499))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Following the Revolution, the frequency and seriousness of crime were seen as increasing, and cries of alarm could be heard in both the burgeoning cities and quieter countryside. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=503))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Beginning in the 1790s, reformers, legislators, and penal authorities conceded that public punishments should be abandoned and incarceration adopted. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=511))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Moreover, the institutions of family, church, and community could no longer absorb the rising numbers of the poor, criminal, insane, and other marginal social types (immigrants, freed blacks) who were seen as threats to the fragile new nation.

	- Prominent among these new beliefs were the ideas that men are equal and that human beings are naturally good and can improve or perfect themselves morally. Indeed, the chief con cern of the Enlightenment was to procure the ideal relationship between man, society, and the state.

	- The rhetoric of the Enlightenment suggested that misguided individuals could be persuaded to exercise moral restraint, good judgment, and self-control. Therefore, severe draconian laws were unnecessary, as free men would voluntarily change their ways (Kann, 2005).

	- crime was explained in terms of sin and disobedience to God and earthly authorities, crime in the nineteenth century was attributed to archaic legal codes that were counterintuitive to the theory of free will.

	- Jeremy Bentham elevated utilitarianism to a moral science in his An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation (1789). ([Location 583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=583))

	- Beccaria asserted that barbarism had no place in punishment, for it was not the intensity of punishment that had the greatest effect on the human spirit, but its duration. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0747S2GPV&location=615))
