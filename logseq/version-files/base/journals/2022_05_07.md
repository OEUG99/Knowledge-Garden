	- Now, what options do you have for communication between the model and the view?
	  1. Push: all the data the view needs is being pushed into it, typically by the controller.
	  2. Pull: the view gets all the data it needs from where it needs it itself.
	- the second one is obviously more self-contained. if you need to push data into the view, that means someone outside the view needs to know what the view wants. And especially views can be quite dynamic and change often. Someone decides to display one more widget in the top right corner, and suddenly the view needs more data. That means other parts need to be recoded to push more data into the view. So you need to alter at least two indepedent parts just because the view was altered.
	- The better option is to give the view a handle that allows it to talk to the model and get all the data it needs itself. The controller just tells the view "we need form XYZ now, here's a handle to talk to the model, go!" and the view can do its job.
