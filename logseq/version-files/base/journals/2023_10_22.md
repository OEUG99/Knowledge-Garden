  Target heart rate is generally expressed as a percentage (usually between 50 percent and 85 percent) of your maximum safe heart rate. The maximum rate is based on your age, as subtracted from 220. So for a 50-year-old, maximum heart rate is 220 minus 50, or 170 beats per minute. At a 50 percent exertion level, your target would be 50 percent of that maximum, or 85 beats per minute. from https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/understanding-your-target-heart-rate#:~:text=The%20maximum%20rate%20is%20based,or%2085%20beats%20per%20minute.
