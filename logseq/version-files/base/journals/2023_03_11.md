			- # What is the 1st Amendment all about?
			  amendment:: [[First Amendment]]
			  heading:: 1
				- What the consitution says verbatem: {{cloze "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances}}
				- There are four rights established in the First Amendment.
					- Right to free exercise of religion
					- Right to free speech
					- Right to free press
					- Right to peaceably assemble and petition the government.
				- What about the right to free expression?
					- The right to free expression comes from the following {{cloze Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech}}
						- In the late 18th century there was a debate of what 'speech' exactly entailed.
							- Some argued that it only meant that Congress could not *suppress* speech, but they could still *punish* speech after the fact.
								- This was called **prior restraint**.
						- By today's standard, speech is viewed as "expressive communication"
							- This means, speech is not just verbal or written speech, but anything that can be deemed "expressive".

			- # What is Sedition?
			  heading:: 1
				- Sedition refers to conduct or speech that incites people to rebel against the authority of a state or government.
				- ## Sedition in the early republic:
				  heading:: 2
					- The federalist-dominated Congress worried about keeping the young nation together in the face of criticism from Republicans and Europeans.
						- [[@John Adams]]'s federalist presidency (1796-1800) was especially wary of [[@Thomas Jefferson]] and his relationship to France.
					- What is the Sedition Act of 1798 ?
						- This act was passed by the United States congress during the presidency of [[@John Adams]].
						- The law made it a crime to publish or speak anything that was deemed to be "false, scandalous and malicious" against the U.S. government, Congress, or the president.
						- The sedition law was still more liberal the nEnglish sedition laws.
							- In England, it was no defense to crime of seditious libel that the statement was True.
							- In the United States, truth has *always* been a defense against the charge of libel.
						- This strict law caused backlash from advocates of free speech and free press, which ultimately led to the "Revolution of 1800".
							- resolutions argued that the Sedition Act violated the [[First Amendment]].
								- [[@James Madison]] authored the "Virginia Resolution" in 1798.
								- [[@Thomas Jefferson]] authored the "Kentucky Resolution" in 1799.
							- In 1800, [[@Thomas Jefferson]] narrowly defeated [[@John Adams]] in presidental election.
								- Jefferson pardoned all those convicted of sedition under the 1798 law.
							- In 1800, representative [[@James Madison]] published a lengthy report defending the Virginia Resolution.
								- He argued that in England, "it is a principle, that the parliament is unlimited in power".
									- ((640d060b-58a9-45cb-a69c-f056c223c050))
									- ((640d0624-481e-43b4-ab8a-72a29eb56f4d))
				- ## Sedition and "clear and present danger"
				  heading:: 2
					- During [[World War 1]], Federal courts began to hear challenges to criminal laws that prohibited and punished "incendiary" criticism of the war.
						- The [[@Woodrow Wilson]] administration sought to suppress. challenges to the war.
					- Eventually the **"Clear and present danger" tes**t was established
						- When speech posed an imminet danger to substanial goverment interest, it would not be protected by the first amendment.
							- eg: "yelling fire in a crowded theater"
							- TODO officer holmes
				- ## Bad tendency test
				  heading:: 2
					- political speech that advociates unlawful behavior or has tendency to produce unlawful behavior is not protected.
					- more easily generalized standarded.
				- Both of these tests are no longer the law but were important for history.
				- ## Advocacy of unlawful acts:
				  heading:: 2
					- ## abstract veruses concrete:
					  heading:: 2
					- ### Where did Court (finally) draw the line?
					  heading:: 3
				- ## Brandenburg test for advocacy of imminent lawless action
				  heading:: 2
		- ## Schenck v. United States, 249 US 47 (1919)
		  heading:: 2
			- Facts:
				- during ww1, sociallist charles schenck distrubuted leaflets opposing the war and draft.
					- he argued that the draft was a form of slavery and violated the 14th amendment.
						- the leaflets urged the public to disobey the draft, but advised only peaceful action.
							- "civil disobedience", but no violence.
				- Schenck was charged with conspiracy to violate the espionage act of 1917.
					- attempting to obstruct the draft was a violation of the act.
				- schenck was convicted of violating this law and appealed on the grounds that the statue violated the first amendment.
			- ### issue:
			  heading:: 3
				- Did the espionage act violate the first amendment?
			- ### Holding (9-0)
			  heading:: 3
				- No, the espionage act did not violate the first amendment.
			- ### Reasoning
			  heading:: 3
				- justice holmes: the effect of the leaflets could only be to obstruct the draft
					- while normally such speech may be protected, during war time it presented a "clear and present danger"
				- right to free speech was not absolute
					- does not protect violence
					- "what are the consequences of the speech in this circumstance"
		- ## Debs v. United States (1919)
		  heading:: 2
			- facts:
				- On june 16, 1918, egune debs, a 1912 social party candiate for the president, delivered a speech in canton, ohio, where he advocated for socialism and against the war with germany.
					- the corut is not a big fan of socialist
					- part of the speech encouraged interference.
						- tried to interfere with military recruitment during world war 1
				- debs was convicted of violating the espionage act of 1917 and sentenced to 10 years in prison
					- the indictment claimed that he attempted to cause insubordination and refusual of duty in US military.
						- also alleged attempted obstruction of recruitment and enlistment.
					- he appealed his conviction on first amendment grounds.
			- ## issue:
			  heading:: 2
				- Did debs' conviction under the espionage act of 1917 vioalte his first amendment rights to free speech.
			- ## holding (9-0)
			  heading:: 2
				- no, the espionage act did not violate the first amendment.
			- ## Reasoning:
			  heading:: 2
				- The unanimous opinion held that advocacy of opinions is not protected by the first amendment if the words had a natrual tendency and reasonably proabble effect to obstruct the recruiting servuce.
					- "this was called the **"the bad tendency test**
		- ## Gitlow v. Ny (1925)
		  heading:: 2
			- facts:
				- gitlow was arrested in 1919 for distributing the "left wing manifesto"
					- 1600 copies were printed so it was not a "big time" paper.
						- We see the law is upheld once again, but it is not unanimous
						- justice holmes, the author of the last, switched to the dissent.
					- In the manifesto, he calls for overthrow of the goverment
						- convicted of criminal anarchy
						- applying the bad tendency test, does it apply here or has it gone too far?
							- ny court of appelas disagreed and those that this law passed.
					- gitlow argued that the statue penalized utterances without showing a tendency to incite concrete action.
			- issue:
				- does the first amendment prevent a state from punishing political speech that directly advocates the goverment's violent overthrow, as in new york's criminal anarchy law?
			- holding (7-2)
				- No, the criminal anarchy law did not violate the first amendment
					- upholding the law but only by 7-2
			- reasoning:
				- majority opinion reasoned that the law did not deprive the defendent of his liberty of expression
					- freedom of expresison was not absolute
						- this is not abstract enough to call for action.
				- holmes says this guy does not have any chance at actually overthrowing the goverment
					- if we do, we'd have to deal with a lot more cases and be a lot picker.
		- ## Stromgberg v california (1931):
		  heading:: 2
			- facts:
				- Yetta stromberg raised a red flag at a children's camp in the san bernardino mountains
					- the youth camp was for working class children and maintained by communist groups.
				- he was convicted of violating california law against anarchist symbols.
			- issue:
				- did the law violate the first amendment?
			- Holding (7-2):
				- yes, the law violated the first amendment.
			- Reasoning:
				- the majority opnion reasoned that the state law was overly broad in its restriction of speech.
					- First time the court ruled that something went so far to violate the first amendment.
					- early incorperation case:
						- doesn't normally come until the 1950s-1960s
						- states can violate the freedom of speech.
					- substantive due process
					- free speech is not absolute, not ulimited
						- now the language is "incitement"
							- bad tendency -> clear and present danger -> incitement
						- this exactly the kind of stuff that the first amendment protects
							- minority opinions should be protected too
							- you have the right to think this, as long as you are not advocating for a violent overthrow.
		- ## Historical turn towards protecting speech
		  heading:: 2
			- stromberg was the first state law overturned as a violation of free speech.
				- then the court became more protective of speech
			- brandenburg v. ohio
				- member of the kkk who was advocating not good stuff
					- he wins because he was not inciting violence
				- created a test:
					- purpose of speech is to incite lawless action in the near future
					- actually must be likely to happen:
						- ex. not just in front of your mirror at home.
					- this test narrows when speech is unprotected because it represented incitement.
						- unless it advocated imminent lawlessness
							- ex. a person speaking to a mob and telling them to riot.
			- ## Expressive conduct:
			  heading:: 2
				- is conduct part of free speech?
					- interpreted to also cover artistic expression (ex. art, erotic movies, etc.)
						- hardcore pornography is not protected.
				- pure conduct has nothing to do with freedom of expression.
					- expressive is too according to a test.
				- laws that regulate expressive conduct, it will have a higher scrutiny.
					- purpose of the law cannot be to supresses expression.
					- you can regualte it but only if really necessary.
				- cases related to expressive conduct:
					- burning draft card
					- burning american flag
					- burning cross (racially motivated)
		- ## United states vs o'brien (1968)
		  heading:: 2
			- facts:
				- in the 1960s, all men who registered for the draft received a credit-card sized certificate.
					- needed to have a draft card at all time to show that they are not evading the draft
						- for the vietnam war.
					- the law states that anyone who messes with the card is guilty of a crime.
				- in 1966, david o'brien burned his draft card at south boston courthouse in front of a crowd.
					- said he was "expressing his opposition to war'
				- he was convicted under a federal law that made the destruction or mutilation of a draft card a crime.
					- the conduct was not jus
			- issue:
				- does the law prohibiting destruction of a draft card violate the right to free speech?
			- Holding (8-1):
				- No, the law against draft card destruction did not violte the first amendment.
			- Reasoning:
				- this law was content-neutral.
				- o'brien said there should be a broad test
					- expressive conduct wual pure conduct
				- when expression and conduct are combined, is there a non-expressive reason for the draft card law? Yes! lots of ways for o'brien to express himself with out burning the card
				- justified if:
					- 1. it is within the consitutional power of goverment
						- the power of congress to conscript manpower for military service is "beyond question"
					- 2. it furthers an important or substantial goverment interest
						- congress has a legit interest in preventing their destruction.
					- 3. content-neutral
						- law is not about suppressing expression, it is about how all of the men can have the draft card.
					- 4. narrowly tailored:
						- the law is narrowly aimed at protecting the country.
		- ## Texas vs Johnson (1989)
		  heading:: 2
			- facts:
				- protestors gatehred in dallas for the 1984 republican convention at dallas city hall to protest reagan adminstration policies.
					- protesting proliferation (increase) of nuclear weapons during the cold war.
				- Johnson marched into city hall and burned the american flag.
				- Johnson was convicted under a texas law outlawing "desecration of a venerated (respected) obeject"
			- issue:
				- Does the law prohibiting descration of the american flag violate the right to free speech?
			- holding (5-4):
				- yes, the law against flag burning violates the first amendment.
			- Reasoning:
				- majority opinion reasoned that Texas did not have a valid state interest for limiting the right to free expression.
					- yes, this is expressive conduct
						- has purpose
					- whenever we have a case about expressive conduct, we are focused on the government purpose.
				- state said two reason for this law
					- preserve the flag and keep the peace
				- we don't buy the logic that this bridges the peace
					- if the purpose to not allow flag burning is to keep national unity, that looks like you're supressing expressive conduct.
				- offensive speech is still protected free speech!
					- even if you're offended by the burning of the flag, it is protected.
		- ## r.a.v vs city of st paul (1992)
		  heading:: 2
			- facts:
				- rav (a minor) and several other white teens assembled a cross out of chair legs and burned it inside the ffenced yard of a black family in st paul, minnesota.
				- convicted under the following ordiance:
					- you cna't destroy or harm people based on:
						- race
						- color
						- creed
						- religion
						- gender
				- case really comes down to the Language of the law
					- what they did was a crime, but the law that they were convicted under violated the first amendment
				- the law is aimed a very certain kind of expression
			- issue:
				- is the st. paul "bias-motivated" crime ordinace a violation of the right to free speech?
			- holding (9-0)
				- yes, the law violates the first amendment.
			- reasoning:
				- You cannot right not content neutral laws.
					- this law was not content neutral
				- this is not a general ordiance.
				- it could survive if they could show that this is the only way to achieve their goal
					- you could've written the law differently and it would have been content neutral.
			-
		- ## Political Speech:
		  heading:: 2
			- political speech is viewed as being at the core of the first amendment.
				- this is not very controversial
			- how does this extend to spending money on political campaigns?
				- Spending money is generally considered conduct, not speech
					- but campaign spending has a strong expressive elemnt.
						- the money is being used to support a political message.
							- ex. making a doccumentary about a bad political canidate.
					- limits on political spending must be related to the governments interest in limiting corruption and the appearance of corruption.
						- ex. if someone donates millions of dollars, it might look like the candidate has some role in the donation.
						- goverment does not want the candidate to look "paid for" by some random company
						- not all about leveling out the playing field!
				- main distinction in law is between contributions and expenditures
					- 1. contributes to political canidates (i.e. "hard money")
						- hard money can be regulated.
						- this is a form of expression of support for the canidate.
							- limits on contributions are permissible
						- the goverment sort of approaches this in a heightend sense.
					- 2. independent expenditures that support a political canditate or political cause (i.e. "soft money")
						- again, this is a form of political expression
							- limits on expenditure violate the right to free speech.
						- "i'm not giving you money, i am donating money to a cause"
					- in short...
						- contribution = direct money to a canditate
							- this is protected by the first amendment!
								- serves a compelling interest.
							- expenditures = money spent on a cause.
				- ## buckley v. valeo (1976)
				  heading:: 2
					- facts:
						- to addres concerns over corruption in political camapigns, congress passed the federal election comission act (feca) in 1971.
							- the law restricted finacial contribtions to candiatates as well as voverall expenditures related to political canidates.
								- 1. limited expenditures that be made directly to a candidate ($1000)
								  2. limited finacial contribtions in total ($25000)
							- The federal election comission (Fec) was created to enforce this statue.
						- the act was challenged as violating the first amendment by a group of candiates, contributors, and political parties, including senator james l. buckley.
					- Issue:
						- Did the limits on political contribitions and expenditures by the fec act of 1971 violate the first amendment
					- holding (7-1
						- yes and no
							- the contributions limits do not violate the first amendment, but the limits on expenditures do.
					- reasoning:
						- The majority held that the contritbion limits are constitutionally valid while the expenditure restrictions are not
							- 1. the contribution and expenditure limits involve first amendment activities.
								- if you'regoing to say that this doesn't violate free speech by limiting money sepnt, some could respond saying that money is free speech.
								- political spending = protected.
							- 2. spending money is not expressive conduct for which a lower level of scrutiny could be applied
								- interesting because they normally say this when a law will be rejected.
							- 3. the consitution limits can be justified by limiting the actuality and appearance of corruption resulting from large individual finacial contribitions.
								- contributions are more suspecious.
							- 4. the first amendment requires the invaldiation of the acts indepdent expenditure cieling, its limitation on canditates's expenditures from his own personal funds, and its ceilings on overall campaign expenditures.
								- with expenditures, the regulation is the same as contributions without the compelling goverment interest.
							-
				- ## mcconell v. fec (2003)
				  heading:: 2
					- facts:
						- in early 2002, congress passed the bipartsian campaign reform act of 2002 (bcra), also called the "mccain-feingold" bill.
							- both were concerned about finacial spending in politics
							- two key parts of the law involved "soft money" and "issue advertising"
								- a) soft money: ban on unrestricted donations made directly to political parties.
									- title I
									- giving money to support a political party
								- b) issue advertising: limits on the advertising that unions, coperations, and nonprofit orgs can engage in up to 60 days prior to an election and restrctions on political parties.
									- title II
									- "issue ads" can be finaced with soft money and without disclosing the identities of the sponsors.
										- anonymous donations for advertisements
							- The  law was directly appealed to a special three-judge panel.
								- the panel struck down portions of the campaign finance reform act's ban of soft-money donations but upheld some of the act's restrictions on the kind of advertising that parties can engage in.
									- a little bit more narrlowly tailored.
						- issue:
							- does the "soft money" ban and restrictions on political advertising in the bcra vioalte the first amendment?
						- holding (5-4):
							- no, the bcra restrictions regarding expenditures do not violate the first amendment
								- pushed buckley further in the direction of regulating political money.
						- reasoning:
							- majority opinion up held the bcra's two principal complemtnary features: the control of soft money and the regulations of elecioneering communications.
								- 1. restrictions on soft money donations to national political parties have limited impact on the first amendment rights
									- extendingbuckley to allow a little bit more
										- "we think that this soft money looks a lot like contributions to individual canditates and thus should be regulated"
								- 2. the ban on soft money to political aprties is justified by the prevention of corruption
									- has the same goal of prevention of corruption
									- really large contributions o parties is sort of simialr to contributions to individual canidtates.
								- 3. the regulation of issue adertising it not prohibited by bucjley's distiniction between express and issue advocacy.
							- Disssent (justice scalia) reasoned that the majority opinion contained "three fallcious proposition"
								- 1. money not speech
									- we have held that money is speech.
								- 2. pooling money is not speech
									- pooling money is not speech
										- if an individual freedom of speech is violated when you tell them they cannot spend money, a group would also have their rights vioalted also
									- 3. speech by coperations can be abridged.
									- main motivation isn't the direction connect to political corruption but rather the dislike for the amount of money in politics in general.
										- if money influences politis, then democracy has a larger issue a t hand
								- dissent (justice thomas) argued that the corut upholds what can only be described as the most signifivant abridgement of the freedoms of speech and association ince the civil war.
									- justice thomas takes a consistent approach.
					- ## citizens untied vs fec (2010)
					  heading:: 2
						- facts:
							- citizens untied, a nonprofit coperation, produced a documentary"hilary the movie"
								- the film provided ciritical commentary about whether senator hillary clinton would make a good president..
									- in jan 2009 the movie was released in theaters and on dvd.
									- they wanted to release this right before the relection (this was sort of soft money)
										- spending money on an advertisement.
								- because the film opposed a political canidate and was funded by a coperation, it fell with the bcra restrctions on "electioneering communications"
									- a coperation cannot sepnd this money in this way this close to the election
										- within 30 days of the election.
							- issue:
								- Are the bcra restrctions on "electrioneering communictions" as applied to a partesian documentary film a violation of the first amendent?
									- are the disclosures requirements for issue adverments a violation against the firt amenent
										- where is the money coming from?
								- holding (5-4)
									- bcra restrictions on electioneering communications violates the right to free speech, but the disclosure provisions do not.
										- opposite of mcconnell
								- reasoning:
									- majority opinion held that there is "no basis for the preposition that, in the context of political speech, the goverment may impose restrictions on certain disfavoured speakers" suc has corperations.
										- poliitical speech is the most protected form of speech, even right before an election.
										- first amendment protections extend to coperations.
											- mcconnel made it sound like corperations were a different category.
											- austin case: as far as the gov. went in regulating speech
												- anti-disortion instead of anti-corruption
												- "we can regulate speech because money is different in public perception"
										- freedom of speech is protected for coperations!
											- austin should be overturned
												- this and mcconel moved past buckley in what was allowed and then this case brought it back to buckley.
											- a disclosure requirement does not prevent anybody from speaking
												- anti-money does not mean anti-opinion
										- concurring opinion (justice scalia) disagree that the original understaind of the first amendment would all restrictions on coerpate speech.
											- corperate money should not be as important as individuals.
										- dissenting opinion (justice stevens) reasoned that the "conceit that corperations must be treated identically to natrual persons in the political spehre is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the court's disposition of this case"
						- ## mccutcheon v. fec (2014):
						  heading:: 2
							- facts:
								- the bipartisan campaingn reform act (bcra) established two sets of limitions to campaign contribtions:
									- the **base** limit palced resitrctions on how much money an individual may give to specified catagories of recipients
										- on candidate
									- the **aggregate** limit placed restrictions on how much money an individual may donate in two-year election cycle.
										- all candiates.
								- shaun mccutcheon was an alabama resident who donated to the republican party national commitee and individual canidates in the 2011-20122 election cycle.
									- delt with contributions not expenditures
									- he wished to donate more.
								- mccutcheon and the other plantiffs sued the federal election comission, arguging that the aggregate limit violated the first amendment.
							- issue:
								- does the aggregate campaign contribution limit violate the right to free speech?
							- Holding (5-4)
								- yes, the aggregate contribution limit is unconsitutional.
							- reasoning:
								- a majority opinioned reasoned that aggregate limits of contributions are not justified by the goverment interest in preventing corruption.
									- narrowing buckley
									- must be "quid pro quo" (this or that)
								- conncuring opinion (justice thomas) argued that "this case reppresented yet another missed oppertunity the right to course of campaign fiance jurisprudce by restoring a standard that is faithful to the first amendment"
								- disenting opinion (justice breyer) reasoned that "the first amendment advanced not only the individuals rights to engage in political speech, but also the public's interest in preserving a democratic order in which collective speech matters"
							-
		- ## right to free epxression
		  heading:: 2
			- to criminalize a form of expression, the goverment must prove a compelling goverment interest.
				- this applies to protected expression.
					- most expression is protected.
				- but there are also unprotected forms of expression
					- the court has said that there is a comeplling goverment interest in regulating this
						- gitlow v ny (1921)
							- unprotected expression: there are categories that have a cpmeplling goverment interest that is balanced agaisnt expressive value.
					- unprotected epxression involves tradtional police powers.
						- the typical thing that the state typically regualted
							- force and fraud
							- public order
							- public morality.
			- ## Main catagories of unprotected speech:
			  heading:: 2
				- 1. advocacy of imminent lawless behavior.
					- expresions aimed at inciting imminent lawless action and likely to produce it is not protected.
						- brandenburg test.
					- brandenburg vv. ohio (1969)
						- ohio "criminal syndicalism" prohibited advocacy of crime or violance as a means of achieving reform (even if there was not imminet threat)
						- to constutute advocacy of imminent lawless behavior
							- 1. the expression must be directly aimed at inciting imminetn lawless action
							  2. the expression must be likely to bring about imminent action.
					- other examples of expression that are not advocacy of imminent lawless bjeavior:
						- during vietnam, anti-war activist arrested for saying "if they ever make me carry a rifiel, the first man I want to get is L.j.b"
						- during a campus anti-war demonstration, students blcoked a street and were removed by the police; one student said "we'll take the fucking street later"
							- scous held that the statement was no advocacy of imminent illegal action.
							- naacp leader said that black citizens who vioalted a boycott of white merchants would be disciplined and was sued for lost earnings by the merchants.
								- saying that the naacp threatened black sitizens
									- to abstract
								- scodus held that the statement was not advoacy for imminent illegal action or incitement.
				- 2. fighting words
					- expression that is likely to provoke an average person to retaliate with a violent breach of peach is not protected:
						- chaplinksy v. new hampsire (1942)
							- scous upheld caplinksy's conviction of calling a police officer a "damn facist"
							- fighting words: words that cause fighting and a violent breach of peace
						- today, "stirring to anger", or being "offensive" is no longer sufficent
							- cohen v californaia (1971)
								- scotus reversed conviction for defendant who wore a shirt with "fuck the draft" message.
									- words/acts must provoke violece and bespciefic
									- there was a content-neutral law in california but the court said that this does not count as fighting words since it does not directly insight violence.
							- scotus has not upheld any criminal law on fighting words grounds since chaplinksy
								- might be empty category of unprotected speech - though relevent in the context of "hate crimes"
									- in rav v. city of st paul (1992) majorit opinion suggested that a viewpoint neutral "fighting words" ordiance might survive consitional scrutiny
								- this still exists in principle, but is not really seen anymore.
				- 3. fraudulent misrepresentiaton:
					- expresison that is intended to defraud is not protected
					- fraud: conversion of property through deciet
					- false expression intended to decieve another.
				- 4. defamation
					- false speech that damanges another's reputation.
				- 5. obscienty
					- predominatly appelas to "pruient interest" (roth v. us, 1957)
						- prurient- exiting lustful thoughts about sexual acitivity.
							- tradtional police powers to regualte "public morality"
						- today, mostly limited to "hard-core pronography" (miller v. califronia, 1974)
					- expression does not just include speech
						- includes theater, film, etc.
					-
			- ## is defamatory speech protected?
			  heading:: 2
				- defamation includes common law torts of libel and slander
					- both involve false statements that are damaging to a person's reputation
						- libel = written statements
						- slander = oral statements
				- but defemation involves speech involves speech, so is there a right to defamatory speech?
