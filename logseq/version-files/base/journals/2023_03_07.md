  topic:: [[Individual Rights]], [[Free Speech]]
  amendment:: [[First Amendment]]
  heading:: 1
	- ## Facts:
	  heading:: 2
		- This case centers around a Chicago attorney named Elmer Gertz who sued the publisher of a magazine for defamation. The publisher, Robert Welch, inc., released an article alleging Gertz of being a communist. Additionally, they alleged that Gertz also had a criminal record. Gertz denied these allegations, and stated that such defamation caused immense damages to his reputation. As a result, Gertz  sued for compensation on damage to his reputation.
	- ## Legal Issues
	  heading:: 2
		- The legal issue being prompted in this case was centered around whether or not public figures have the same level of defamation protection as the ordinary private individual. The supreme court, prior to the case, in cases such as New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, determined that public figures require a higher burden for proof in regards to defamation, requiring malice intent; however, there was some ambiguity in this court ruling and the extent such extra proof was to be applied.
	- ## Holding:
	  heading:: 2
		- In this case, the court held that public figures hold no entitlement to the same degree of protection from defamation as your ordinary private individual. To summarize what the court found, the court determined that because individuals have a greater reach in terms of influence and greater means to access the media to disseminate a message, public figures do not need the same level of protection. Despite this though, the court still did find that public figures deserve at least some protections shared by private citizens, mainly the established guidelines for defamation cases needing to prove malice intent, which means someone knowingly making a false statement, or is aberrant to the truth of a situation.
		- The supreme court in this instance did not affirm the lower court's decision. In fact, the lower court dismissed the case, whereas the supreme court did not, and established it as a standard for future cases involving defamation.
	- ## Reasoning:
	  heading:: 2
		- Interestingly, this case had a majority opinion which was authored by Justice Powell. The reason behind it was that public figures voluntarily entered into the spotlight, thus they shouldn’t have the same level of protection as ordinary citizens. They also clarified some cases where public figures need protection, such as when responding to accusations is not easy for public figures to respond.
		- In regards to dissent there were four. To best summarize their concerns, they simply felt that the court's decision did not do enough to protect regular people, as they believed people who aren’t famous should be able to more easily sue for defamation.
- # Roe vs Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)
  topic:: [[Individual Rights]]
  amendment:: []
  heading:: 1
	- ## Facts:
	  heading:: 2
		- This case centers around a pregnant woman, with the pseudonym Jane Roe and other women seeking a class action lawsuit against a Texas statute criminalizing abortions. The lawsuit seeked to challenge the constitutionality of such statues, like Texas’s abortion statue.  Ultimately, this case would later become a landmark case in terms of abortion rights, and would be revisited and appealed in 2022.
		- Additionally, this case served as one of the pivotal cases in the Women’s Rights movement which predominantly took place in the 1960s, but extended into the early 1970s. It is also worth considering that during the enactment of abortion laws, at the time the state believed it had a responsibility to enforce these laws, as abortion procedures were risky.
	- ## Legal Issues
	  heading:: 2
		- In March of 1970, Jane Roe sought a declaratory judgment that she hoped would state that such statues were unconstitutional, thus preventing statues like Texas’s from being enforceable. Roe at the time stated that she was ‘unmarried and pregnant’ and ‘that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion’. She also stated that she attempted to seek a legal abortion in Texas; however, because her life was not being threatened by the pregnancy, it would have been illegal to terminate the pregnancy. Additionally, she also claimed she could not afford to travel to different jurisdictions in order to receive a legal abortions. Roe framed the Texas statue as violatory, infringing on her right to “personal privacy”, which was guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fith, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments.  In regards to the other side’s stance, the state believed that they had a responsibility to protect the life of the unborn child, and as touched on previously the states initially created abortion laws with the intentions to protect women.
	- ## Holding:
	  heading:: 2
		- The court ultimately decided that “the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulations.” (Barnett & Blackman, 2018, Page 453).
		- Simply put, the court determined that the appelle failed to meet “this burden of demonstrating that Texas statute's infringement upon Roe’s rights was necessary to support a compelling state interest. (Barnett & Blackman, 2018,  Page 453). Additionally, the appelle could not fully prove that prenatal life, or in other words a fetus, was a “person” as outlined in the Fourteenth Amendment. This is of importances as the Constitution never defined what a “person” was, rather it just used the word. Additionally, every use of the word was only associated with postnatal actions (Barnett & Blackman, 2018,  Page 453), thus the courts found that there was no constitutional nor historical basis to conclude that prenatal life was protected under the Fourteenth amendment, meaning the Supreme Court reserved the lower court's decision.
	- ## Reasoning:
	  heading:: 2
		- The majority opinion, which was written by Justice Harry. Blackmun, found that the Texas statutes criminalizing abortions violated a women’s rights to privacy. Specifically, the Court found that the statute violated the implicit liberties guaranteed by the due process clauses of the Fourteenth amendment.
		- In regards to dissenting opinions, Justice Rehnquist questioned if this case was really about the right to “privacy”. He found that seeking an abortion ‘is not “private” in the ordinary usage of that word” and nor did he find that this “privacy” was a remote relative to the privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment, i.e: protection against “unreasonable searches and seizures.” Additionally, Justice White joined Justice Rehnquist citing similar rhetoric: “I find nothing in the language or history of the constitution to support the Court’s judgements.” Lastly, there were no concurring opinions (Barnett & Blackman, 2018, Page 457).
	- ## Modern Context:
	  heading:: 2
		- Though not touched on in the textbook, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade on June 24th, 2022.. This marked a roll back of over 50 years of judicial precedent, dismantling abortion as a federal right in the United States, and in the process returned the power of abortion legislation to the individual states. This decision came after a rare leak, which revealed a draft of Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion. Both the leak, and overturning previous judicial precedents represent something out of the norm for the Supreme Court.
		- Though not explicitly asked in the rubric, I felt that this modern context was needed in order to fully understand the past and present implications of this case.
