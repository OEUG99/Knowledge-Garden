			- ## Role of discretion in the juvenile justice system, the types of factors that influence it, and efforts to control it
			  heading:: 2
				- Discretion plays a crucial role in the juvenile justice system, as it allows system actors to consider the unique circumstances and individual characteristics of each case. It allows for flexability in the applicaiton of justice, accounting for the fact that children and adolesents are still developing and may be more amenable to rehabilitation than adults.
				  
				  Types of discrtion:
				  1. police discretion - police officers decide whether to arrest a juvenile offender or deal wit hteh situation informally. 
				  
				  2. court discretion: judges and prosecutor have discretion in deciding whether to try a juvenile in juvenile court or adult court, which can significantly affect the outcome of a case. They also have discretion in determining the approprate punishment , which could range from
			- ## Justification and criticisms of early juvenile justice system
			  heading:: 2
				- Early juvenile jusice system were based on the following principles:
					- recogition of developmental differences.
					- focus on rehabilitation - goal was to help jvenile offenders become productive members of society.
					- protection of youth - protect from harsh conditions and influences in adult prisons.
				- criticisim of early juvenile justice system:
					- lack of due process - juvenile court proceedings often did not provide same procedural protections found in adult courts
					- inconsistent application of justife:
						- broad discretion given to judges often lead to inconsistent and potentially unfair outcomes. For example, two juveniles who commited similar offenses might recieve very different sentences depending on the judges views.
					- ineffectiveness at rehabilitation:
						- many juveniles continued to reoffend leading to questions about the effectiveness of the system's interventions.
					- conditions in juvenile facilities:
						- juvenile detention facilities were citicized for being harsh and did not conduct rehabilition.
					- these conditions eventually led to reforms in the 1960s.

			- ## Identifying dynamic vs. static risk factors
			  heading:: 2
				- risk factors in the context of criminal justice and criminology are charteristics, traits, or circumstances that increase the liklihood that an individual will engage in criminal or deliquent behavior. They can be classified into two main categories
				- There are **two** types of risk factors **static** and **dynamic**.
					- **Static** risk factors are historical factors that cannot be changed. They are "static" because they have already occurred and will not vary over time. They help to assess an individual's risk level but, because they cannot be changed, they don't offer targets for intervention. Some examples of these are:
						- **age at first offense**
						- **history of antisocial behavior**
						- **criminal history**
						- **family criminality**
					- **Dynamic** risk factors, are also known as criminogenic needs, are factors that potentially can be changed through intervention. They are "dynamic" because they can vary over time and can be influenced by circumstances or interventions. These risk factors are particularly important in planning for treatment or rehabilitation because they can potentially be reduced or eliminated, therby lowering the individual's risk of reoffending. Some examples of dynamic risk factors include:
					- 1. **Substance Abuse**: substance abuse can increase the risk of criminal behavior, but it can potentially be addressed through treatment.
					  2. **mental health issues**: Mental health issues, such as depression or personality disorders, can increase risk, but they can potentially be managed or treated.
					  3. **Peer associations**: having friends or associates who engage in criminal behavior can increase risk, but these associations can potentially be changed.
					  4. **Lack of employment or eduction**: lack of employment or education can increase risk, but these circumstances can potentially be improved through interventions.
			- ## Least restrictive placement principle
			  heading:: 2
				- The least restrictive placement principle is the idea that juveniles should be housed in the least restrictive setting that consistent with public safety and their own treatment needs. This might mean, for example, placing a juvenile in a community-based program rather than a secure detention facility, if that would be sufficient enough to meet their needs to protect public safety.
				- The goal of LRP is to ensure that individuals are not uncessarirly isolated or restricted, but rather are intergrated into the community and given as much indepndence as is appropriate to their circumstances. This is based on the beleif that individuals are more likely to learn, grow, and rehabilitate in environemnts that are as normal and inclusive as possible. However, the application of this principle must be ballanced against other considerations, such as the neeed to protect public safety in the context of juvenile justice system.
			- ## Definition and application of the Risk Needs Responsivity Model
			  heading:: 2
				- The Risk-Needs-Responsivity (RNR) model is a framework that guides the assesment and treatment of offenders in the criminal justice system.
				- Developed by Robert R. Andrews and James Bonta, and is based on decades of empirical research.
				- RNR model has three core principles:
					- **risk principle: ** this principle suggests that the level of service should match the offender's risk to reoffend. High-risk offenders require intensive intervention, while low-risk offenders require minimal or even no intervention. Applying high-intensity interventions to low-risk offenders can actually increase their likelihood of reoffending.
					- **need principle:** this principle identifies criminogenic needs, which are dynamic risk factors that, when changes, are associated with changes in the likelihood of reoffending.  example of criminogenic needs include antisocial behavior, antisocial peers, antisocial personality pattern, history of substance abuse, lack of education or employment, and family problems. the needs principle suggest that the effective intervetnion program should target these criminogenic needs.
					- **Responsivity principle:** this principle suggest taht intervention should be delivered in a style and mode that is responsive ot the offender's abilities and learning style. it emphasizes the importance of theraputic relationship and the use of cognitive-behavioral strategies to effect change.
			- ## Name and purpose of Risk Assessment instruments reviewed in class
			  heading:: 2
				- PACT - positive achivement change tool risk assesment was mentioned in class.
					- designed to asses the youth's risk to re-offend (recividism risk) and identify the youth's criminogenic needs.
					- The PACT uses a structured interview process to gather information about a youth across several life domains that research has show to be related to deliquent behavior. These domains include:
						- it makes scores for **criminal history**, **social history**.
					- information gathered from these scores are used to classify into risk levels (low, moderate, or high) to help determine the intensity of sueprvision and intervention needed.
					- PACT also identifies the youth's criminogenic needs.
					- In the context of risk assessment tools like the PACT (Positive Achievement Change Tool), the **AUC** is used to measure the tool's ability to accurately distinguish between two outcomes—for instance, whether a juvenile offender will reoffend or not.

				- • Felitti et al. 1998
				- the concept of ACE originated from wide-scale study conducted by Kaiser permanate's health appraisal clinic.
				- this study found that younf people who often get int troulbe with the law have many aces. Young people are more likely to have mental health problems, suffer from drug abuse, and/or have difficulty in school. By being aware of this information, JJS actors can hopefully address these issues plaguing young people.
			- ## Method for measuring individual ACEs and ACE score
			  heading:: 2
				- self report questionare, where individuasl are asked about different experiences prior to age of 18, covers  factors such as physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, household dyshunction. There are 10 different categories.
				- TODO ask about the 10 catagories and if we should know them all
			- ## Purpose and definition of Trauma Informed Care
			  heading:: 2
				- TIC is a treatment framework that involves understanding, recognizing, and responding to various types of trauama. It emphasizes physical, psychological, and emotional safety for both service providers and survivors, and it works to rebuild a sense of control and empowerment for the individuals it serves.
			- ## Examples of TIC policies and practices prioritized in FLDJJ
			  heading:: 2
				- Training staff on trauma: educating staff about the effects of trauma, the principles of trauam informed care, and the way to implement these principles in their work.
			- ## Definition and purpose of the TRACE survey
			  heading:: 2
				- Trauma Responsive and Caring Environment (TRACE) Self Assessment is a tool that can be used by organizations to assess their progress in becoming more trauma-informed. The self-assesment covers 6 domains:
					- Leadership and governance
					- culture and environment
					- staffing and workforce development
					- program and services
					- data and evaluation
					- community engagement.
				- For each domain, the self-assesment asks a series of questions about the organization's current practices and policies. the questions are designed to help organization identify areas where they can improve their trauma-informed care.
			- ## Goals of diversion programs
			  heading:: 2
				- reduce deliquency
				- reduce/minimize system contact
				- optimize system resources
			- ## Defining net widening and describing implications for diversion programs
			  heading:: 2
				- TODO this
			- ## Ideal Candidate for Diversion Programs and Challenges in Differentiating These Ideal Candidates
			  heading:: 2
				- Youth subject to formal processing.
					- concerns with net widening.
				- Low risk
					- first time offense
					- Misdemeanor offense
			- ## Function and Purpose of Civil Citation Program
			  heading:: 2
				- civil citation programs are alternatives to tradtional criminal justice rpcoess, particularlly for minor offenses and first time offenders. The overall aim of these programs is to divert eligible individuals from the criminal jusitce system and reduce the poential negative impacts of criminal charges and convictions. They are often used for offenses like petty heft, minor drug posessions, disorderly conduct, and similar low-level crimes.
				- Often these reduce recividvism, like in florida
			- ## Barriers to Civil Citation Utilization
			  heading:: 2
				- County-specific exclusions such as domestic violence, battery touch or strike,e tc.
				- law enforcement buy-in
					- tough-on-crime
					- education efforts (e.g., roadshows)
				- failitary:
					- turnover among key personnel.
			- ## Complications of Diversion and Civil Citation Programs
			  heading:: 2
				- Some complications consist of the following:
					- coercion of youth
					- potentially worse the nformal processing
						- may minor offense dropped
						- failing civil citations
					- use of diversion is discretionary
						- police make civil citation decisions
						- racial disparities
						- place disparities.
					- Offense vs offender focused.
						- criteria based offense, not offender information
						- What alternative critieria oculd be considered?
					- Implementation of diversion programs
						- substainial requirements
						- quality of services.
			- ## Relationship and Mechanisms Underpinning Education and Delinquency
			  heading:: 2
				- deliquency's impact on education:
					- reaction to deliquency:
						- teacher/per rejection
						- exclusionary discipline
						- parental relationship
					- Negative effect on
						- engagement
						- achivement
							- linked to deliquency
							- future edctional achivements
							- occupational achivements

					- What impacts can juvenile justice syste have?
						- prevention:
							- education programs
							- diversion
						- minimizing education distruption
							- community-based placement
							- encourage engagement
						- accelerate achivement
							- system achievement
							- reenrollment
			- ## FLDJJ and Educational Initiatives/Decisions
			  heading:: 2
				-
			- ## Defining School to Prison Pipeline
			  heading:: 2
				- Harsh school discipline polices, such as zero-tolerance policies and school suspensions, have been found to contribute to "school-to-prison pipeline"
				- students who are suspended or expelled are often left unsupervised and without constructive activities. They also fall behind in schoolwork, and many drop out of school entirely. Not being in school increase the chance of them coming into contact with the justice system
				- Inasequate reosurces in public schools, particularly, in low income communities, are another factor for increase likelyhodo of CCJ interaction
				- Disproportation impact on minority students - this means that the pipeline dispropartianately affects minority students, particularly black and hispanic students, as well as those with disabilities. These are the ones often disciplined more hasley for the same behaviors are peers.
			- ## Reentry and Education
			  heading:: 2
				- poor post release outcomes
					- >25% of youth dropout within 6 months of release
					- low graduation rates
				- educational protective factors
					- academic achivement
					- reentrolment
					- literacy
				- ways to support re-entry
					- after care service
			- ## Firearm Lethal Violence Trends Nationally
			  heading:: 2
				- firearms is catching up to motovechicles for deaths in children.
			- ## Correlates of Youth Firearm Violence
			  heading:: 2
				-
			- ## Sources of Firearms for Youth
			  heading:: 2
				- family  friends and street/black market are common sources
				- theft, such as stealing from cars.
			- ## Firearm Offenses vs Referrals
			  heading:: 2
				- Firearm offenses:
					- A firearm offense refers to any criminal act that involves the use or possession of a firearm. Firearm offenses can include a wide range of acitvities, such as illegal possesion of a firearm, carrying a concealed weapon with out a permit, using a firearm in the comission of a crime, or discharging a firearm in a public place. Firearm offenses can be commited by both adults and juveniles, and the severity of the offense can very depending on the circumstances.
				- Refferals:
					- A juvenile refferal is a formal process by which a oyung person (typically under the age of 18) is reffered to the juvenile justice system for alleged criminal behavior. Refferals can come from a variety of sources, including law enforcement, schools, parents, or community members. Once a refferal is made, the juvenile justice system will typically conduct an intake process to determine the appropriate course of action. This may include diversion programs, probation, or formal corut proceedings.
			- ## System Responses to Firearm Violence
			  heading:: 2
				- law enforcment agencies response to incidients of firearm violence, they collect evidence, etc. they also collaborate with other agencies to develop strategies for reducing gun violence.
				- criminal justice response:
					- decides wither to prosecute or not, decides what to charge suspects with, depending on circusmtances.
					- the court determines guilt, innocences, and also impose sentences, such as incareration, probation, fines, etc.
				- public health agencies may also respond to uptick and try to create effective strategies to reducin firearm violence.
				- there may also be political and legsislative response based on firearm usesages, both on the local,state and federal level.
			- ## Defining Focused Deterrence
			  heading:: 2
				-
			- ## Legal Definition of Juvenile Human Trafficking in Florida
			  heading:: 2
				- Juveniles definition is similar to the general ((644ecaff-ddde-4bfe-ade9-a686fc979d0b))
				- Except: no requirement for force, fraud, or coercion for sex trafficking
				- Juvenile commercial sexual explotation definition:
					- use of child for sexual purposes in exchanges for money, goods, or services , or the promise of money, goods, or services.
					- broad defintion of sexual purposes:
						- physical sex
						- pornography
						- live/online shows
					- DOES NOT REQUIRE knowledge of the juveniles minor status.
			- ## Relationship Between ACEs and Human Trafficking Victimization
			  heading:: 2
				- Aces are more prevelant in trafficking population:
					- emotional abuse
					- physical abuse
					- sexual abuse
					- emotional neglect
					- physical neglect
					- family violence
				- indicative of child maltreatment
				- Trafficking ACE score was higher (4.45 vs 3.77)
			- ## Policy Implications of Human Trafficking Research
			  heading:: 2
				- Educating practitioners
					- no single profile for trafficking victims
					- Counter myths of "typical" trafficking victim
				- Identifying youth complicated:
					- some factors can be indicative
						- e.g., sexual abuse
					- heterogeneity lends itself to experienced based items rather than characteristics.
			- ## Methods and Process for Identifying Human Trafficking Victims
			  heading:: 2
				- By using screening tools, we can identify both labor and sex trafficking victims.
				- the DJJ uses a pre-screen tool to identify potential victims
				- Human Trafficking Screening Tool has more in-depth items.
				- Potential cases are refereed to Department of Children and Families for investigation.
