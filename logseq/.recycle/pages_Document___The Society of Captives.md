	- The guard in his tower holds a position organized around the theme of potential crisis, the possible event made improbable by vigilance. It is a theme which we will encounter often in our examination of the prison. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=538))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The society of prisoners, however, is not only physically compressed; it is psychologically compressed as well, since prisoners live in an enforced intimacy where each man’s behavior is subject both to the constant scrutiny of his fellow captives and the surveillance of the custodians. ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=543))

	- ```md
	- Thus he enters the custodial institution, a poor man in terms of material goods; later he will be given other things (a change of clothing, a cup, a spoon, blankets, etc.), but they will place him only just above the line of bare necessity. ([Location 550](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=550))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In a very fundamental sense, a man perpetually locked by himself in a cage is no longer a man at all; rather, he is a semi-human object, an organism with a number. The identity of the individual, both to himself and to others, is largely compounded of the web of symbolic communications by which he is linked to the external world; and as Kingsley Davis has pointed out, “. . . the structure of the human personality is so much a product of social interaction that when this interaction ceases it tends to decay.” ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=581))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Humanitarian motives, combined with a growing doubt about the efficacy of solitude and meditation as means of reform, led to a search for alternatives to isolation, ([Location 586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=586))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In his annual report of 1838, the Keeper admitted that . . . solitary confinement apparently had little influence in decreasing the amount of crime committed within the state. And his annual report for 1839 contained an admirable analysis of the fundamental defects in the system of solitary confinement on the physical health of the prisoners through the ([Location 589](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=589))

	- ```md
	- Yet the New Jersey State Prison does not represent acute physical discomfort, nor is there evidence of shockingly bad living conditions. Rather, it gives the impression of a grinding dullness, an existence lacking the amenities of life we take for granted, but an existence which is still tolerable. ([Location 605](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=605))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The prison wall, then, does more than help prevent escape; it also hides the prisoners from society. ([Location 610](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=610))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The prison is not an autonomous system of power; rather, it is an instrument of the State, shaped by its social environment, and we must keep this simple truth in mind if we are to understand the prison. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=614))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- in the case of riots, the inmates can capture the attention of the public; and indeed disturbances within the walls must often be viewed as highly dramatic efforts to communicate with the outside world, efforts in which confined criminals pass over the heads of their captors to appeal to a new audience. ([Location 616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=616))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The prison, as a social system, does not exist in isolation any more than the criminal within the prison exists in isolation ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=622))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Yet why is imprisonment appropriate? ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=627))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The idea of punishment as the purpose of imprisonment is plain enough—the person who has committed a wrong or hurt must suffer in return. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=631))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Imprisonment should be punishment, not only by depriving the individual of his ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=634))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- liberty, but also by imposing painful conditions under which the prisoner must live within the walls. ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=634))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Those, however, who hold that reformation is the major aim of imprisonment—who feel that if the custodial institution fails to reform it fails altogether—are apt to argue that such additional penalties present an insuperable barrier to therapy. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=733))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Similar forces are perhaps at work when society demands that the custodial institution take on the appearance of a self-sustaining community. ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=744))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The freedom of the prisoner, whether it is granted in the name of humanity, economic efficiency, or reformation, and limited though it may be, creates a situation in which crimes among inmates are possible. ([Location 753](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=753))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The prison exists as a dramatic symbol of society’s desire to segregate the criminal, whatever reasons may lie behind that desire; and the prison wall, that line between the pure and impure, has all the emotional overtones of a woman’s maidenhead. ([Location 774](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=774))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Certainly there is no convincing proof that the majority of the imprisoned criminals are bent on flight. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=788))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Nearly 55 percent of the inmates in the institution can look forward to being released within two years ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=791))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Yet at the same time the officials of the prison are convinced that some inmates—an unknown number—will seize the slightest opportunity to break out of the institution and that in dealing with these men a moment’s inattention is an invitation to disaster. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=793))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Unfortunately, the prison officials can predict only in the grossest fashion which of their captives will try to elude them, ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=800))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The custodians, however, do not stop with these, for they have found to their bitter knowledge that in a maximum security prison the most innocent-appearing activity may be a symptom of a major breach in the institution’s defenses. ([Location 814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=814))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- A committee appointed by Governor Alfred E. Driscoll in 1952 to investigate the prison noted that the institution has long served as a dumping ground or catch basin for the state’s entire correctional system; and in their report the committee stated that “. . . the inmate population of Trenton Prison included, in addition to the ‘ordinary’ prisoners who constitute the majority of the population, insane and near-insane, mental defectives, unstable psychopaths, some of them highly assaultive, prisoners convicted as sexual psychopaths, passive homosexuals, aggressive ‘wolves’ with long records of fights and stabbings, escape artists, agitators, and ‘incorrigibles’ of all ages.”5 ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=827))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- What is innocent now may prove dangerous later—as when a route of exchange for cigarettes becomes a route of exchange for weapons. Gambling may lead to unpaid debts, unpaid debts may lead to a knifing. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=865))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In the prison, however, a different calculation is at work—the assurance of order is regarded as worth the price paid in terms of the inmate’s subjugation to detailed regulations. ([Location 873](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=873))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- the fact that custodians and inmates are caught up in the complex of work has profound implications for the nature of imprisonment. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=920))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The custodians cannot remain simply custodians, content to search a cell for contraband or to censor the mail; now they must manage men as well.8 ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=929))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The monotonous, unskilled nature of most jobs in the prison provides little intrinsic work satisfaction and the incentive of Work Time, like retirement benefits and other distant rewards of the free community, presents many drawbacks as a motivating force for here and now. ([Location 943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=943))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- and the prior deviance of the prisoner is a rationalization for using such extreme measures' to avoid any events which would excite public indignation. ([Location 999](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=999))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Education, recreation, counselling, and other measures designed to lessen the oppressiveness of prison life assume a relatively minor position compared to a system of control which attempts to make the prisoner learn compliance to duly constituted authority. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=1042))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- Within the walls, in the clearcut scope of the custodian’s responsibilities, the occurrence of escapes and disorders is a weightier concern. ([Location 1086](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=1086))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The most striking fact about this bureaucracy of custodians is its unparalleled position of power—in formal terms, at least—vis-à-vis the body of men which it rules and from which it is supposed to extract compliance. The officials, after all, possess a monopoly on the legitimate means of coercion (or, as one prisoner has phrased it succinctly, “They have the guns and we don’t”); ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=1156))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- The custodians have the right not only to issue and administer the orders and regulations which are to guide the life of the prisoner, but also the right to detain, try, and punish any individual accused of disobedience— ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001B0MD3K&location=1164))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- In our examination of the forces which undermine the power position of the New Jersey State Prison’s custodial bureaucracy, the most important fact is, perhaps, that the power of the custodians is not based on authority.
