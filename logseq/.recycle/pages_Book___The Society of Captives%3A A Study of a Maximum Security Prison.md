	- ## Chapter 1: The Prison and it's setting
	  heading:: 2
		- First prions had high walls, surrounded by low income dwellings, and railroad tracks. The high walls was a barrier to escape, but it also represented society's rejections.
		- Despite riots and escapes being infrequent due to high walls, the first prisons were heavily armed and guarded.
			- Guards hold a position organized by the theme of potential crisis, the possible event made improbable by vigilance. This is a common theme with the examinations of prisons.
		- "The society of prisoners, however, is not only physically compressed; it is psychologically compressed as well, since prisoners live in an enforced intimacy where each man's behavior is subject both to the constant scrutiny of his fellow captives and the surveillance of the custodians." Page 3
		- Prisoners are stripped of their civilian possessions, only given the bare necessities:
			- "Thus he enters the custodial institution, a poor man in terms of material goods; later he will be given other things (a change of clothing, a cup, a spoon, blankets, etc), but they will place him only just above the line of bare necessity." Page 4.
			- "The prison is supposed to live in poverty as a matter of public policy," Page 4
			- It is said that whoever controlls the Center of the prison controls the prison.
				- "in the vocabulary of the inmates, a *center man* is a prisoner who allies himself to blatantly with the world of the custodians" Page 4
				- "arrogance or disrespect in the Center has special significance as an affront to legitimate authority"
				- The center resembles goverment in some ways.
			- Inmates aren't trapped in cells, they are given some freedom for various activities, such as mess hall, etc.
			- ".. the structural of the human personality is so much of a product of social interaction that when this interaction ceases it tends to decay." Page 6
				- This line of thinking played a large role in the abandonment of solitary confident.
					- "Humanitarian motives, combined with a growing doubt about the efficacy of solitude and meditation as a means of reform, led to a search for alternatives to isolation" Page 6
				- "In his annual report of 1838, the Keeper admitted that . . . solitary confinement apparently had little influence in decreasing the amount of crime committed within the state. And his annual report for 1839 contained an admirable analysis of the fundamental defects in the system of solitary confinement on the physical health of the prisoners through the impossibility of taking normal methods of exercise." Page 7
		- There were constant social demands to reduce the financial burden of imprisonment on the free community.
			- "A demand ill met by keeping the inmates locked in his cell both day and night." Page 7
		- Today Solitary confinement is only used in the New Jersey State maximum security Prison, only for prisons who are being punished for "infractions of the prison rules and it represents the ultimate penalty that custodians can inflict rather than common fate of the man in custody." Page 7
		- Additionally, prison officials no longer "force their captive to remain constantly within the confines of their cells, neither do they permit them to roam freely within the limits set by the wall and its armed guards. n the eyes of the custodians, such a course is prohibited by the elementary requirements of security and the need to main order; **the prison exists in an uneasy compromise of liberty and restraint.**"  Page 7
		- Dull atmospheres in the New Jersey State prison do not represents physical discomfort, rather its meant to evoke a feeling of lacking amenities that we take for granted. Existence here is just tolerable, not miserable.

		- "The prison wall, then, doesn't more than help prevent escape; it also hides the prisoners from society." Page 8
			- Some members of the free world would rather forget about the prisoners
		- "The prison is not an autonomous system of power; rather, it is an instrument of the State, shaped by its social environment, and we must keep this simple truth in mind if we are to understand the prison." Page 8
		- Riots can be viewed as a way for prisoners to try and speak to a new audience (the outside world) when their captors refuse to listen. This is why riots are sometimes highly dramatic.
		- The outside world affects the beliefs and values of the prison system.
			- The employees/captors often come from the outside world, so their beliefs reflect the outside world.
			- "The prison, as a social system, does not exist in isolation any more than the criminals within the prison exist in isolation as an individual; and the institution and its settings are inextricably mixed despite the definite boundary of the wall" Page 8
		- Q: Why is imprisonment an appropriate consequence for most serious crimes?
			- "it is a cliché of modern penology that placing the offender in prison is for the purposes of punishment deterrence and reform." Page 9
			- "The idea of punishment as the purpose of imprisonment is plain enough-- the person who has committed a wrong or hurt must suffer in return" Page 9
				- "Imprisonment should be punishment, not only depriving the individual of his liberty, but also imposing painful conditions under which the prison must live within the walls." Page 9
	- ## Chapter 2: The Regime of the Custodians
	  heading:: 2
		- "The prison is an instrument of the state, an organization designed to accomplish the desires of society with respect to the convicted criminal." Page 13
		- In the previous chapter we talked about how prison's are designed to remove everything that isn't a necessity, included amenities the free world enjoys, with the goal of making prison life dull but livable, and also not cruel.
			- ((6341f316-e3e4-4518-b0b6-20aaebd68910))
		- This chapter talks about how we shift away from that thinking. For example, "those [..] who hold that reformation is the major aim of imprisonment -- who feel that if the custodial institution fails to reform it fails altogether-- are apt to argue that such additional penalties present are an insuperable barrier to therapy" Page 15.
		- Labor is the traditional solution from maximum security prisons being able to support themselves.
			- "Similar forces are perhaps at work when society demands that the custodial institution take on the appearance of a self-sustaining community." Page 16
		- Maintaining order is another important aspect of imprisonment.
			- "the freedom of the prisoner, where it is granted in the name of humanity, economic efficiency, or reformation, and limited through it may be, creates a situation in which crime among inmates are possible." Page 17
				- Theft, murder, fraud, sodomy, all exist inside of prisons and the custodians have to figure out how to prevent them.
					- This contrasts with the reformist view, as stripping of humanity by using something such as isolation to punish these thefts, murders, etc, goes against the doctor-patient relationship and therapeutic approach to punishment/reforming criminals.
			- "The prison exist as a dramatic symbol of society's desire to segregate the criminal" Page 18
				- "One escape from the maximum security prison is sufficient to arouse public opinion to a fever pitch and an organization which stands or falls on a single case moves with the understandable caution. " Page 18
			- Walls and guns are good at keeping prisoners in, but given time and resources  prisoners can overcome it.
				- Thus custodians job to detect this far before it happens.
				- But this doesn't mean all prisoners inherently want to escape. Other factors contribute to them wanting to stay afoot.
					- "nearly 55 percent of the inmates in the institution can look forward to being released within two years" Page 19
				- "yet at the same time the officials of the prisons are convinced that *some* inmates --an unknown number-- will seize the slightest opportunity to break out of the institution and that in dealing with these men a moment's inattention is an invitation to disaster." Page 19
					- "Unfortunately, the prison officials can predict only in the grossest fashion *which* of their captives will try to elude them." Page 20
						- This creates a problem as now prison officials assume the worst in order to ensure those few willing to escape don't manage to do so.
							- This has lead to prison officials treating inmates as equally serious threats, and leads to over use of policies like cell searches, repeatedly counting all inmates, etc.
							- "The custodians, however, do not stop with these, for they have found to their bitter knowledge that in a maximum security prison the most innocent-appearing activity may be a symptom of a major breach in the institution's defenses." Page 21.
		- The task of maintaining internal order is the second most important task in a prison, and it comes after keeping custody.
			- This can be an issue if goverment uses prisons as a dumping ground for the mentally ill. See Page 21 for more information.
			- "In the prison, however, a different calculation is at work-- the assurance of order is regarded as a worth the price paid in terms of the inmate's subjugation to detailed regulations." Page 24
			- Prisoners have some liberty in terms of labor, this is for motivation.
			- In prison there are groups of men who can work and men who can not work.
				- This subset of prisoners is known as the Idle Men.
			- A great majority of prisoners are employees in various occupations.
			- The fact that custodians and inmates are caught up in the complexity of work has profound implications on the nature of imprisonment
				- Prisons need reedom of movement in order to poperly work.
				- secondly, prisoners need tools and resources to work.
				- thirdly, and the most important of all, prisoner works carries an implicit obligation that the man hours dedicated to it will result in something everyday.
			- The issue with labor for prisoners:
				- "The custodians cannot remain simply custodians, content to search a cell for contraband or to censor the mail; now they must manage men as well." Page 28
		- So how do we get prisoners to work?
			- Often the use of solitary confinement and reducing the sentencing is effective at motivating prisoners to work.
			- Unlike the free world, baiting with job promotions doesn't work since there is no hierarchy of power, responsibility, etc.
				- As a result prisoners only really put in the smallest of efforts.
				- "if the value of their work is small, they will be little affected, as long as they do not openly rebel." Page 30.
			- Custodians have a drive to keep prisoners working as efficient as possible, or else they may be replaced.
				- Yet, custodians are often barred from using effective rewards or punishment to secure consistent performance.
		- Custodians are not motivated by a desire to inflict punishments, so how are the many deprivations imposed on the inmates to be explained then?
			- *"the prior deviance of the prisoner is a rationalization for using such extreme measures' to avoid any events which would excite public indignation*" Page 33
		- "Education, recreation, counseling, and other measures designed to less the oppressiveness of prison life assume a relatively minor position compared to a system of control which attempts to make the prisoners learn compliance to duly constituted authority." Page 35
		- "Within the walls, in the clearcut scope of the custodian's responsibilities, the occurrence of escapes and disorders is weightier concern" Page 38
	- ## Chapter 3: The Defects of Total Power
	  heading:: 2
		- "The most striking fact about this bureaucracy of custodians is its unparalleled position of power - in formal terms, at least-- vis-à-vis the body of men which it rules ad from which it is supposed to extract compliance. The officals, after all, possess a monpoly on the legitmate means of coercion (or, as one prison has phrased it succinctly, 'they have guns and we dont'" Page 40
		- "the custodians have the right not only to issue and administer the orders and regulations which are to guide the life of the prisoners, but also the right to detain, try, and punish any individual accused of disobedience." Page 41
		- "the power of custodian is not based on authority" Page 46
			- "power based on authority is actually a complex social relationship in which an individual or group of individuals is recognized as possessing a right to issue commands or regulations and those who receive these commands or regulations feel compelled to obey a sense of duty."

	- **Dear Select Committee members,**
	- In the name of the Florida prison system, I am here speaking to you today. Through my research, I have learned that the prisons in our state are in a dire need of reform, and additionally, no longer serve their intended purpose. The reality is that state prisons are ill-suited for rehabilitation, and have far too often, become a dumping ground for the mentally ill, addicted, and violent. This issue only serves as a distractor; as the initial goal of rehabilitation has become blindsided by the need to maintain order amongst the disordered population. Additionally, this overfitting of the prison populations derives conditions that are deplorable to both the inmates and the prison’s custodians. Consequently, this has created a sub-society repulsively different than our own. One at which that fails to effectively tackle the problem of recidivism. Additionally, another issue plaguing our prisons is the desire for self-sufficiency. Past policies, designed to wall off the burden of prisons from the law-abiding outside world, have forcibly created a self-sufficient economic dogma amongst many prisons. The prospect of such self-sufficiency on the surface seems endearing, yet the reality is that this model is ripped with poisonous fruit. Through this economic model, custodians must now take up the impossible task of being both the caretaker and also an efficient capitalistic manager. Failing to do either result in inhumane conditions, either through underfunding or neglect. This is because the needs of the incarcerated in this monetary model become substituted for the prison’s economic need for self-sufficiency.
	- This speech's goal is to alert you to the pressing problems at hand and, hopefully, offer some solutions that will help our state's failing prisons. The first recommendation I make is to do away with the drive for prisons to be self-sufficient and instead increase funding for services aimed at providing rehabilitation, like education. Secondly, I recommend redesigning inmate classifications to prevent prisons from becoming dumping grounds for vastly different individuals. Instead, I advise categorizing people according to their needs using characteristics like mental illness and severity of offensives. Additionally, I suggest that we identify custodians who are both passionate and knowledgeable about these different prisoner classifications. Giving prisons the financial support they require is crucial, but identifying a committed custodial leader is even more crucial. Only a well-merited custodian can ensure that order and civility are maintained in prisons; money alone cannot.
	- For the aforementioned reasons, I implore you, the Select Committee, to give thought to these suggested solutions and to look into how the prisons in our state might be reformed appropriately to better serve their intended function. Our state’s prisons must act as both a place of retribution and rehabilitation, but due to poor policy decisions, the latter has grown neglected. Nevertheless, I have faith that you, the Select Committee, will reach the right decision. Thank you for both your time and consideration.
	- Sincerely,
	- Gresham Sykes.
