	- This Hour Has Seven Days, where a man identified as Dr. John Money was a guest. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=351))

	- Fifteen years earlier, in 1952, a spate of publicity had attended the announcement by American ex-GI George Jorgensen that he had undergone surgical transformation to become Christine. That operation, performed in Denmark, had been roundly criticized by American hospitals, which refused to perform the surgeries.

	- “The ultimate test of the thesis that gender identity differentiation is not preordained in toto by either the sex chromosomes, the prenatal hormonal pattern, or the postnatal hormonal levels would be undertaken, if one had the same ethical freedom of working in experiments with normal babies as with animals,” ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1011))

	- ```md
	- “Since planned experiments are ethically unthinkable, one can only take advantage of unplanned opportunities, such as when a normal boy baby loses his penis in a circumcision accident.” ([Location 1013](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1013))

	- “extreme unusualness” to the case: the child in question was one of a pair of identical male twins. ([Location 1017](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1017))

	- for his experiment a pair of children whose biology was as close to identical as any two human beings could be: a pair of children whose lives had begun with the same primordial zygote cell, whose DNA bore the same genetic blueprint, and whose brains and nervous systems had developed in the womb within the same bath of prenatal hormones. In short, the ultimate matched pair. ([Location 1019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1019))

	- ```md
	- The significance of the case was not lost on the then-burgeoning women’s movement, which had been arguing against a biological basis for sex differences for decades. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1042))

	- Money’s own papers from the 1950s on the psychosexual neutrality of newborns had already been used as one of the main foundations of modern feminism. ([Location 1043](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1043))

	- Sexual Politics, had quoted the 1950s papers as scientific proof that the differences between men and women reflect not biological imperatives, but societal expectations and prejudices. ([Location 1044](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1044))

	- He soon introduced refinements into his crowd-pleasing presentation. At a March 1973 address at the prestigious Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, Money included a slide show in which he displayed a close-up photograph of Bruce’s groin following the loss of his penis and a shot of the twins standing near a doorway. Brian is dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and dark trousers, Brenda in a sleeveless dress, white ankle socks, and white shoes. Money also showed a shot of Brenda alone, taken by Money himself. The child is seated awkwardly on the patterned upholstery of his office sofa. She wears a floral dress and running shoes, her bare left knee lifted self-protectively against the lens, her left hand deliberately obscuring her face.

	- Diamond did not object to Money’s use of “odd and atypical cases” to study gender identity formation. He merely questioned the theoretical conclusions that Money drew from them. ([Location 1075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1075))
	- ```
	- ```md
	- A year later, in 1970, a fellow American joined Diamond for the first time in challenging Money’s theory of human psychosexual differentiation. Dr. Bernard Zuger was a Manhattan-based child psychiatrist whose work treating young male homosexuals and their families had caused him to question the prevailing view that sexual orientation results from rearing and environment. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1092))

	- Zuger suspected a biological basis for homosexuality that contradicted the universally accepted nurturist view—a view, as Zuger later wrote, that was founded to a remarkable degree on Money and the Hampsons’ prize-winning 1950s papers on hermaphrodites.

	- According to the Reimers, however, and to contemporaneous clinical notes, the family’s trips to the Psychohormonal Research Unit only exacerbated the confusion and fear that Brenda was already suffering. ([Location 1180](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1180))

	- The twins soon developed a conviction that everyone, from their parents to Dr. Money and his colleagues, was keeping something from them. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1188))

	- “They’d tell me, ‘You shouldn’t be ashamed of being a girl,’” David says. “They’d say, ‘Girls can do the same things as boys.’ One woman—an associate of Dr. Money’s—told me, ‘That’s a typical tomboy thing; I did the same thing. You’re just a tomboy.’ But I was saying to myself, No, it’s not quite like that. I don’t think that’s quite it.” ([Location 1196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1196))

	- But Brenda did not draw a girl. Instead she produced the standard childish representation of a boy, which her tester, Money’s student R. Clopper, called a “stick figure.” Asked who it was, Brenda said, “Me.” Asked to draw a figure of the sex opposite to herself, Brenda refused. Only after what the notes describe as “considerable coaxing” did she draw another stick figure, which she called “Brenda with a ponytail.” Then she changed her response to “Brian,” then changed again and said it was Brenda herself. Asked what the “opposite sex” figure to herself was wearing, Brenda said, “A dress.” ([Location 1205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1205))

	- Pornography, he believed, was ideal for this purpose. “[E]xplicit sexual pictures,” he wrote in his book Sexual Signatures, “can and should be used as part of a child’s sex education.” Such pictures, he said, “reinforce his or her own gender identity/role.” “He would show us pictures of kids—boys and girls—with no clothes on,” Brian says.

	- the children did not enjoy these enforced activities—particularly those involving “play at thrusting movements and copulation,” which Brian recalls that Dr. Money first introduced when the twins were six years old. Money, he says, would make Brenda assume a position on all fours on his office sofa and make Brian come up behind her on his knees and place his crotch against her buttocks. Variations on the therapy included Brenda lying on her back with her legs spread and Brian lying on top of her. On at least one occasion, Brian says, Dr. Money took a Polaroid photograph of ([Location 1298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1298))

	- Today David is still unwilling to speak about it. “There are some things I don’t want to remember,” he says. In 1989 he did describe the sessions to Jane Fontane, the woman who would become his wife. The two had just watched a TV documentary on CIA torture involving electroshock to people’s genitals. “He cried hysterically,” Jane told me. “He was crying about John Money. I’d never seen him like that. I tried to comfort him. David said Dr. Money made him go on all fours and made Brian go up behind his butt. They were being photographed. He mentioned that very act.” ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00AXXUB2G&location=1304))
