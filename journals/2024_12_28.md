	- Types of Functions
		- Function Decleration
			- ```js
			  function greet(name) {
			      return `Hello, ${name}!`;
			  }
			  ```
			- The traditional way of creating a function. It declared by compiler at compilation time, meaning that you can't change its definition at run time. Prevents redeclaring them.
		- Function Expressions
			- Only it's variable gets moved to the top at compilation, meaning it's definition can be changed at run time.
			- ```js
			  var greet = function() {
			      console.log("Hello, World!");
			  };
			  ```
