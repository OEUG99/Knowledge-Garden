- [[JavaScript]]
	- **Deconstructing:** a way of extracting values from objects and assigning them to variables; or in other words, unpacking properties from an object and assigning them to distinct variables to improve readability.
		- Example:
		  ```js
		  const person = {
		    name: 'John Doe',
		    age: 30,
		    job: 'Developer'
		  };
		  
		  // Without destructuring
		  const name = person.name;
		  const age = person.age;
		  const job = person.job;
		  
		  // With destructuring
		  const { name, age, job } = person;
		  
		  console.log(name); // John Doe
		  console.log(age);  // 30
		  console.log(job);  // Developer
		  ```
