		- [[CSS]]
			- When working with css, start with a type selector, then move to a class selector, then move to an ID selector. This way it is easier for styling and dealing with inheritance.
				- When there are multiple used, the most specific will be selected. For example if you have a class and an ID, if both set the background then only the ID will be used.
			- It is possible to have an element have two or more CSS selectors at the same time. This is done by chaining selectors.
				- example:
					- ```css
					  h2.destination {
					  font-family: Tahoma
					  }
					  ```
			- Additionally, we can select elements that are nested in other elements via descendant combinators.
				- Example:
					- html:
						- ```html
						  <ul class='main-list'>
						  <li> ... </li>
						  <li> ... </li>
						  <li> ... </li>
						  </ul>
						  ```
					- css:
						- ```css
						  .main-list li {
						  
						  }
						  ```
			- We can add css styles to multiple css selectors all at once by doing the following:
				- Before:
					- ```
					  h1 {
					  font-family: Georgia;
					  }
					  
					  .menu {
					  font-family: Georgia;
					  }
					  ```
				- After:
					- ```css
					  h1, 
					  .menu {
					  font-family: Georgia;
					  }
					  ```

		- Notes from quiz:
			- `<style>` allows CSS rules to be written in a HTML document. `<link>` is used to link external stylesheet files.

			- # Pseudo-classes
			  heading:: 1
				- Pseudo-classes are special identifiers in CSS that allow you to select and style elements based on their state or position in relation to other elements on the page. They are preceded by a colon (:) and can be applied to a variety of selectors such as links, form elements, and list items.
				  
				  Some common pseudo-classes include:
				  
				  :hover: This selects an element when the user hovers their mouse over it. You can use this to apply styles such as changing the background color or adding an underline to a link.
				  
				  :active: This selects an element while it is being clicked or tapped. You can use this to apply styles such as changing the background color or adding a border to a button.
				  
				  :focus: This selects an element that has focus, such as an input field or a link that can be tabbed to. You can use this to apply styles such as changing the outline or border of the element.
				  
				  :visited: This selects a link that has been visited by the user. You can use this to apply styles such as changing the color or text-decoration of the link.
				  
				  :first-child: This selects the first child element of its parent. You can use this to apply styles such as changing the margin or padding of a list item or table cell.
				  
				  These are just a few examples of pseudo-classes, and there are many more available for you to use in your CSS styling.
				- example:
					- ```css
					  p:hover {
					  background-color: lime;
					  }
					  ```

			- # Styling in CSS
			  heading:: 1
			- In CSS we can style element types via the following:
				- ```css
				  h1  {
				  color:  red;
				  }
				  ```
			- we can also style elements by their id via the following:
				- ```css
				  #name { 
				  color: blue;
				  }
				  ```
			- For styling by their classes we can do the following:
				- ```css
				  .classname {
				  color: orange;
				  }
				  ```
			- Lastly, we can also style via attributes.
				- ```css
				  [href] {
				  color: teal;
				  }
				  ```
			- We can combine elements and attribute styling to get real specific.
				- ```css
				  img[src*='winter'] {
				  height: 50px;
				  }
				  
				  img[src*='summer'] {
				  height: 100px;
				  }
				  ```
