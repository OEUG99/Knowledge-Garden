		- FLOW:
			- The user first interacts with the Atuh gateways.
				- A user registers, creating a User object which handles their login and password, also assigns JWT tokens.
				- This user Object creates an empty profile.
				- These object get serialized via their repos and stored in databases.
			- When user loads their profile page, they interact with the profile gateway. We grab the JWT token from the client and will use that in our requests.
		- TODO:
			- Perhapse refact each model class to have a .save method().
