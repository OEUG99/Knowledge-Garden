		- ## Summary
		  heading:: 2
			- Generics are like [[C++/Templates]].
				- HOWEVER they are instantiated differently.
			- Generics can be used in methods and in classes
				- Unlike C++ Templates, Generics can not be used in primitives.
			- Syntatically similar to C++ tempaltes, but instantiated differently when compiled.
				- A C++ template generates separate copies of the code for each instanced type.
				- Java typically uses one compiled version, where the type parameter is replaced with a more general parent type (thus making legal cals via polymorphism)

			- ### Basic Usage
			  heading:: 3
				- Set up by putting at type parameter before the method's return type, and use the type parameter name in place of fixed types in the method signature (and definition, if necessary.) Example:
				- ```java
				  public static < T > void PrintArray ( T[] arr )
				  ```
					- Type parameters receive actual type arguments when the method is called
						- Operation in the method body must be legal for the type argument used in call, or compiler errors will occur
					- Type parameters can represent only reference types, not primitive types
					- **Type Erasure:** when instantiated, the above translates to the method:
						- ```java
						  public static void PrintArray(Object[] arr)
						  ```
						- This process of replacing the type parameter with actual type is called **type erasure**.
			- ### Upper Bounds of Type Parameters:
			  heading:: 3
				- In the process of erasure, type parameters are replaced with their **upper bound**
				- Unless specified otherwise, `Object` is the default upper bound of the type parameters
				- To declare an upper bound on a type parameter, use the keyword `extends`, followed by the class or inferface thati s to be upepr bound.
				- Example:
					- If a generic method will use the `compareTo` method, declare the `Comparable<T>` generic interface as the upper bound with:
						- ```java
						  public static < T extends Comparable< T > > T minimum(T x, T y, T z)
						  ```
						- Note that `Comparable < T >` objects **will** have a `CompareTo()` method. The translated version of method after erasure will be:
							- ```java
							  public static Comparable minimum(Comparable x, Comparable y, Comparable z)
							  ```
							- Now, the following call is legal, since `String` implements `Comparable<String>`
								- `String min = minimum("One", "Three", "eight")
							- **Special Case:** even though type parameters acna only take reference types, the following calls are legal due to being an added feature since Java 1.5.0, called **autoboxing**, where primitive types (like int) can sometimes be auto-converted to objects of the corresponding "type wrapper" class (like Integer):
								- ```java
								  int m1 = minimum(6,9, 10);
								  double m2 = minimum(3.3, 10.5, 1.1);
								  ```
			- ## Generic Classes
			  heading:: 2
				- ### Creating a generic class
				  heading:: 3
					- A generic class is declared like ar egular class, with a type parameter section after the class name:
						- ```java
						  public class Table< T >
						  ```
					- The type parameters(s) can be used throughout the class, including in generic methods, to represent the element type(s).
					- The type parameter cannot be used after `new`, to create objects or arrays. To create an array, for example, create an array of type `Object` (or whatever the type parameter' upper bound is), and then downcast the reference variable to the generic type:
						- ```java
						  private T[] list; // array variable, i.e. in a class
						  list = (T[]) new Object[size]; // creating of array of reference variables.
						  ```
