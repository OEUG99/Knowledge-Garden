- 17:28 |  [[Big O]]
	- Summary of reading:
		- Big O can be used to describe run-time in three different ways
			- best case
			- worst case
			- average case
		- Time complexity is not the only thing Big O can measure, it can also measure space complexity.
		- Constants are dropped when we measure complexity.  The non-dominate term is dropped because we want to focus on the most significant factor that influences the growth rate of an algorithm.
		- TODO Look into amortized time for Big O.
