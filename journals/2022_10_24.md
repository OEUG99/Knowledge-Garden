- Class Notes:
	- He talked about drawing polygons with `drawPolygon()`, `drawPolyline()`, `fillPoygon()` inside a JPanel.
		- Example he showed can be [found here](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/notes/deitel7/ch12/fig12_27_28/)
	- He then talked about Java2D -- He did not go to far in depth, just enough for us to understand the library. He wants us to explore the rest on our own
		- [Example 1](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/notes/deitel7/ch12/fig12_29_30/)

		- [Example 2](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/cop3252/notes/deitel7/ch12/fig12_31_32/)
	- He went over the `Shape` interface., and mentioned how you can pass them in to the draw function for graphics 2d.
	- He also talked about `setPaint()` for `Graphics2D` and the `GradientPaint` object.
		- ((6356cb64-2a86-4ed4-ad77-ecbac8d89d18)) is a good example of gradients, inside the JPanel class.
